"[Question]Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than 1/3 as often as the big bell. If he rings both of them a combined total of 52 times, how many times does he ring the big bell?\n"
"[Answer]Let s be the number of times the small bell rings, and b be the number of times the big bell rings. We know that s + b = 52 and s = 4 + 1 / 3b. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 4 + 1 / 3b + b = 52. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 1 / 3b + b = 48. Combining like terms, we get 4 / 3b = 48. Dividing both sides of the equation by 4 / 3, we get b = 36. The answer is 36.\n"
"Q: Two puppies, two kittens, and three parakeets were for sale at the pet shop. The puppies were three times more expensive than the parakeets, and the parakeets were half as expensive as the kittens. If the cost of one parakeet was $10, what would it cost to purchase all of the pets for sale at the pet shop, in dollars?\n"
"A: Puppies cost three times more than parakeets, or 3 * $10 = $30 per puppy. Parakeets were half as expensive as the kittens, or 2 * $10 = $20 per kitten. Two puppies cost 2 * $30 = $60. Two kittens cost 2 * $20 = $40. And three parakeets cost 3 * $10 = $30. Thus, the cost to purchase all of the pets for sale at the pet shop is $60 + $40 + $30 = $130. The answer is 130.\n"
"Question: Rex is taking lessons for his driver’s license. He wants to take 40 hour-long lessons before his test, and decides to have two-hour sessions twice a week until he has done his test. After 6 weeks, how many more weeks will Rex need to continue taking lessons to reach his goal?\n"
"Answer: Each week, Rex is taking 2 hour - long lessons * 2 times a week = 4 lessons. After 6 weeks, he has done 4 lessons per week * 6 weeks = 24 lessons. So Rex still needs 40 total lessons – 24 lessons taken = 16 lessons. He will therefore need lessons for another 16 lessons / 4 lessons per week = 4 weeks. The answer is 4.\n"
"[Question]Kekai is running a sundae booth at the carnival. On Monday, he makes a total of 40 sundaes, and he puts 6 m&ms on each sundae. On Tuesday, he makes a total of 20 sundaes, and he puts 10 m&ms on each sundae. If each m&m pack contains 40 m&ms, how many m&m packs does Kekai use?\n"
"[Answer]On Monday, Kekai uses 40 * 6 = 240 m&ms. On Tuesday, Kekai uses 20 * 10 = 200 m&ms. Kekai uses a total of 240 + 200 = 440 m&ms. Kekai uses a 440 / 40 = 11 m&m packs. The answer is 11.\n"
"Q: Roberta started off with 8 vinyl records. Her friends gave her 12 records for her birthday and she bought 30 more at a garage sale. It takes her 2 days to listen to 1 record. How many days will it take her to listen to her record collection?\n"
"A: She had 8 records, received 12 and bought 30 for a total of 8 + 12 + 30 = 50 records. It takes 2 days to listen to 1 record and she has 50 records it will take her 2 * 50 = 100 days. The answer is 100.\n"

"Getting mud off your shoes may not be the most exciting task, but it's certainly necessary to maintain cleanliness in your home and the longevity of your footwear. Here are detailed steps on two methods you can use:\n"
"\n"
"Method 1: Dry Cleaning\n"
"\n"
"1. Allow the Mud to Dry: It might sound counter-intuitive, but allowing the mud to fully dry can make it easier to remove. Attempting to clean away wet mud may only serve to spread it and deepen the stain. In order to speed up the drying process, place your shoes in a warm, dry spot. However, avoid placing them on a heater or in strong sunlight, as these can damage the material of your shoes.\n"
"\n"
"2. Scrape off the Mud: Once the mud is dry, you can begin the process of removing it. Using an old toothbrush, a nail file or a specialised shoe brush, gently scrape off the mud. Be careful to avoid damaging the shoe material. Always brush in the same direction to prevent unnecessary wear.\n"
"\n"
"3. Clean the Outsoles: Pay extra attention to the outsoles, or the bottom part of your shoes. This area typically gathers the most dirt and debris. Use your tool to scrape the mud from grooves or patterns in the shoes.\n"
"\n"
"4. Wipe with a Dry Cloth: After you've scraped off as much mud as possible, wipe over your shoes with a clean, dry cloth to get rid of any lingering dust.\n"
"\n"
"Method 2: Wet Cleaning\n"
"\n"
"1. Preparing the Shoes: If the mud is too wet or if the dry cleaning method is not enough, you may need to follow a wet cleaning method. Before you start this, make sure to remove the laces and insoles if possible to prevent them from getting wet and to clean more thoroughly.\n"
"\n"
"2. Rinse Your Shoes: Using warm water, thoroughly rinse the mud off your shoes. Avoid using high pressure streams as it might damage the material of your shoes.\n"
"\n"
"3. Create a Cleaning Solution: In a bowl, mix warm water with a few drops of mild detergent or dish soap.\n"
"\n"
"4. Clean your Shoes: Dip a soft brush or an old toothbrush into the cleaning solution and start scrubbing the mud spots gently. Ensure not to forget the sides and tops of your shoes. \n"
"\n"
"5. Rinse and Dry: Rinse your shoes again with warm water to remove soap suds and residual mud. Pat them dry using a towel to remove as much moisture as possible, then leave them to air dry in a warm spot avoiding direct sunlight.\n"
"\n"
"6. Conditioning: After thorough drying, apply some conditioner if the shoes material permits, to restore its natural shine and prevent cracking.\n"
"\n"
"Remember, if your shoes are made of a special material like suede or leather, they may need a specific shoe cleaning product instead of mild detergent, and more care will be needed when scrubbing.\n"
"\n"
"Both methods can effectively remove mud from your shoes. However, consider the type of shoes, the materials made from, and your comfort level with the cleaning process when deciding which method to use. In some cases, scraping off dried mud might be sufficient and convenient. For harder stains or more durable shoes, a wet clean might be more effective. It's key to remember to clean mud off your shoes as soon as possible — the longer it remains, the harder it is to get off."

"The animal that has species called Grevy's, Cape Mountain, and Plains, among others, is the zebra. Zebras are part of the Equidae family, which also includes horses and asses. They are native to Africa and are particularly known for their striking black and white striped coats, which may play a role in camouflage, temperature regulation, or social interactions. Each zebra species has distinct features, habitats, and conservation statuses.\n"
"\n"
"1. Grevy's Zebra (Equus grevyi): Also known as the imperial zebra, Grevy's zebra is the largest of the three zebra species. They are found in the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Kenya and Ethiopia. Grevy's zebras have thinner, tighter stripes, large rounded ears, and a white belly. They prefer to live in grassland and savannah habitats. This species is known for being more solitary than the other zebras, with male territories often excluding other male zebras. Grevy's zebra is listed as endangered, with habitat loss, competition for resources with livestock, and reduced water availability being significant threats to their populations.\n"
"\n"
"2. Cape Mountain Zebra (Equus zebra zebra): The Cape Mountain zebra, a subspecies of the mountain zebra (Equus zebra), is found in South Africa. It mainly inhabits the mountainous regions of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. They are smaller than the other zebra species, and their stripes are narrower and more numerous. Cape Mountain zebras have a distinct dewlap, which is a fold of skin hanging from the throat area. Threats to this subspecies include habitat loss due to agricultural expansion and competition for resources with domestic animals. While their population was once severely reduced, successful conservation efforts have helped the Cape Mountain zebra recover to a point where they are now classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\n"
"\n"
"3. Plains Zebra (Equus quagga): The Plains zebra, also known as the common zebra or Burchell's zebra, can be found throughout much of eastern and southern Africa. They are the most widespread and numerous of zebra species, inhabiting various environments such as grasslands, savannahs, and open woodlands. Plains zebras have broad stripes that are not as tightly spaced as those of Grevy's zebra, yet not as wide as the stripes on mountain zebras. These zebras are highly social animals and are known for forming harems, which are smaller family units within a large social group called a dazzle. Plains zebras serve as an essential prey species for many predators, such as lions, hyenas, and wild dogs. Currently, they are listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, with their populations mainly affected by habitat loss, poaching for their skins, and competition with livestock for resources.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the animal with species called Grevy's, Cape Mountain, and Plains, amongst others, is the zebra. These three species and subspecies exhibit intriguing adaptations to their environments, social behaviors, and various conservation statuses, making them integral components of Africa's diverse and mesmerizing ecosystems."

"If ever an actor was the theatrical equivalent of a banner headline, that actor is Nathan Lane. Lane, who plays the bellowing editor Walter Burns, arrives a little more than halfway through the revival of The Front Page at the Broadhurst Theatre, splashed across the stage like a 72-point font. His jubilant, giant performance injects a cantankerous vitality into Jack O’Brien’s otherwise pleasant and respectful revival.\n"
"\n"
"The talky, gleefully squawky 1928 play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur is a comedy as black as shoe polish. It is also a passionate op-ed on the romance of the bygone newspaper industry.\n"
"\n"
"The action is set in a press room at the criminal courts building on the eve of the hanging of a cop killer, Earl Williams (John Magaro). The forthcoming execution doesn’t especially trouble the old hands who have gathered here to drink, jaw, play a hand of poker, and call in the occasional story. Their only complaint is the timing of the hanging. “Why can’t they jerk these guys at a reasonable hour so we can get some sleep?” one gripes.\n"
"\n"
"The plot coagulates when Williams escapes from custody, just as the longtime reporter Hildy Johnson (a dapper, oddly wan John Slattery) announces his retirement from the city pages in favor of marriage to Peggy (Halley Feiffer) and a cushy job in advertising. (As Slattery only recently finished his run on Mad Men, that line gets a particular laugh.)\n"
"\n"
"“Journalists,” Hildy complains, “peeking through keyholes. Running after fire engines like a lot of coach dogs. Waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them what they think of companionate marriage … a lot of lousy, daffy ‘buttinskis’, swelling around with holes in their pants, borrowing nickels from office boys! And for what?”\n"
"\n"
"The business, of course, won’t let him go so easily, especially when a scoop beckons.\n"
"\n"
"The set is handsome, the dialogue sharp-witted, the cast an assemblage of some of New York’s finest character actors (Jefferson Mays, David Pittu and Dylan Baker) and big names including John Goodman. The style is vivid and almost expressionist in the way that conversations are layered over around each other. Some of the discussion of race and gender is fairly unreconstructed, but O’Brien has excised the nastiest words.\n"
"\n"
"Yet the revival’s energy is something less than crackling and the enterprise might have seemed merely respectable were it not for the joyously disreputable Lane. Dressed in a homburg hat and a chalk-stripe suit, with a moustache that looks like a chipmunk has attached itself to his upper lip, he gives a performance that is both outsized and just the right size.\n"
"\n"
"A man seemingly devoid of ethics (he won’t let a little thing like kidnapping or arson stand in the way of a good story), his Burns is outrageous, disgraceful and yet impossible not to adore. He represents the best and worst of journalism, the selfish and single-minded pursuit of the truth (and advertising dollars).\n"

Wright until 2009 ) was a chain of about 129 American retail / outlet stores established in 1998 and owned by TJX Companies . Like its sister company T.J. Maxx , AJWright sold clothing , domestics , giftware , footwear , accessories , and fragrances at prices between twenty and seventy percent below regular prices . AJWright differed from other TJX chains by refreshing its merchandise on a regular basis . For most stores , new shipments arrived every weekday . In early 2011 , TJX closed the chain 's remaining stores and converted some stores to other TJX brands . Although AJWright 's primary target market was moderate - income families , its recent expansion drew additional consumer groups . The company 's community service strategy centered on monetary donations to the Boys and Girls Club of America and other affiliates .  - Zayre was a chain of discount stores that operated in the eastern half of the United States from 1956 to 1990. The company's headquarters was in Framingham, Massachusetts. In October 1988, Zayre's parent company, Zayre Corp., sold the stores to the competing Ames Department Stores, Inc. chain, and in June 1989, Zayre Corp. merged with one of its subsidiaries, The TJX Companies, parent company of T.J. Maxx. A number of stores retained the Zayre name until 1990, by which time all stores were either closed or converted into Ames stores. (The TJX Companies, which also owns Marshalls, HomeGoods, and Sierra Trading Post, is still in operation as of 2016.)  - A department store or magazine is a retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different product categories known as \"departments\". In modern major cities, the department store made a dramatic appearance in the middle of the 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and the definition of service and luxury. Similar developments were under way in London (with Whiteleys), in Paris (\"Le Bon Marché\" in 1852) and in New York (with Stewart's).  - Framingham is a town in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 68,318 as of the United States 2010 Census, making it the 14th most populous municipality in Massachusetts.

"Despite their opposing views, Eric and Logan were the best of friends. They always found immense joy in debating various topics, be it scientific, metaphysical, or social. They believed that the key to maintaining such a deep connection was rooted in their mutual respect for one another, regardless of their differing perspectives.\n"
"\n"
"While Logan maintained that the insights he experienced through the power of the crystals had dramatically improved his daily life, Eric couldn't help but attribute this improvement to the power of suggestion. The faith healer, as charismatic as he might have been, seemed to him as just another snake oil salesman peddling false hope to vulnerable souls searching for a higher truth.\n"
"\n"
"Contrarily, Logan was truly enraptured by the faith healer's wisdom and the possibilities that lay dormant within the crystals. Each session with him brought an unforeseen aspect of his existence bubbling to the surface, be it a harmonization of his body's energies, a connection to his higher self, or even a profound lucidity in his dreamscapes.\n"
"\n"
"For Logan, the faith healer was not someone to be ignored; he was a harbinger of a new era of understanding, of achieving the coveted state of spiritual equilibrium. The eventual roadmap to breaking the confines of social conditioning and fostering deep, meaningful connections with others.\n"
"\n"
"And so, as the two wandered through a sunlit glade, the pair continued their discourse. Friends by circumstance, yet showcasing the epitome of the inquisitive human spirit. To them, it was not about who was right or wrong, but the discovery and expansion of their horizons.\n"
"\n"
"In the end, it remained the ever-pervading enigma of existence - the quest to understand that which lay beyond the visible realm. For Eric and Logan, their contrasting beliefs only served to strengthen the unbreakable bond they shared. A bond that transcended their individual views and created an indomitable partnership fueled by curiosity and the thirst for understanding."

"In his first general election event in Wales, Mr Corbyn visited Cardiff North - a seat Labour wants to recapture from the Conservatives.\n"
"The leader used the event to heap praise on the Welsh Government.\n"
"But Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies claimed the Welsh Labour team would be \"gritting its teeth\" during the visit.\n"
"Mr Corbyn was joined by First Minister Carwyn Jones, as well as Cardiff North AM Julie Morgan.\n"
"Speaking on Whitchurch Common to a crowd of around 700, Mr Corbyn said: \"I urge you to come with us on this journey of hope and excitement, not this journey of fear and misery which is all the Tories offer.\"\n"
"Mr Corbyn said the UK government was slicing the money from normal state schools for free and grammar schools.\n"
"He criticised the UK government for cutting the Welsh budget.\n"
"\"In Wales it is different, because you've got a government that is determined to properly fund education and give every child an opportunity,\" he said.\n"
"Friday's event came after Mr Corbyn said children were being crammed \"like sardines\" into \"super-sized\" school classes in England, as Labour focused its general election campaign on education.\n"
"But the Tories called the comments \"a massive own goal\", saying the Labour-led Welsh Government had overseen increases in class sizes in Wales.\n"
"Education in Wales is devolved and Liberal Democrat Education Secretary Kirsty Williams has announced a Â£36m fund to reduce infant class sizes in Wales.\n"
"In the wideranging speech, Mr Corbyn said seven years of the Tory government and the earlier coalition had brought \"greater poverty, greater insecurity, greater misery\", and that Labour was the party of hope and opportunity.\n"
"He said Labour would maintain the triple-lock on pensions, while he claimed big firms would not be allowed \"cosy\" tax negotiations with HM Revenue and Customs.\n"
"Mr Corbyn was surrounded by a large crowd of well-wishers and supporters as he left the scene.\n"
"Welsh Labour leader Carwyn Jones said Labour would create a \"fairer society\" after 8 June.\n"
"\"The time has come for change,\" he said.\n"
"But Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"After nearly two decades in government, Labour's record is a smorgasbord of failure evidenced by Wales having the worst-performing education system in the UK, the lowest take-home pay, and the longest hospital waiting times.\"\n"
"Jonathan Edwards, Carmarthenshire East and Dinefwr Plaid Cymru MP, said: \"Given the current weakness and chaos plaguing Labour, the prospect of a UK Labour government is a complete fantasy.\"\n"
"Meanwhile, Rhondda MP Chris Bryant said he was \"fully supporting\" the leader, despite being a vocal critic when he was voted into the role.\n"
"Make no bones about it - it would have been a good boost for Mr Corbyn to see so many hundreds of his supporters turn out in Cardiff.\n"
"But it is not enough for him to rely on the votes of Labour supporters.\n"
"Take a place like Cardiff North, where the Conservatives have a got a majority of 2,137 votes.\n"
"It is those voters that it will need to attract, that will sometimes vote Labour, sometimes vote for the Conservatives.\n"

"Natalie was more likely to travel to a foreign country than Rachel, because Natalie had an adventurous spirit. This isn't to say that Rachel didn't have her share of adventurousness, but Natalie’s spirit seemed to always be driven by the compelling desire to explore the unknown, to delve into cultures vastly different from her own, and to embrace the spontaneous, untamed nature of travel. There was a spark in her eye when tales of far-off lands, unique cultures, mysterious traditions, and unfamiliar cuisines were shared, a spark that didn't ignite into a flame in Rachel's eyes with the same intensity.\n"
"\n"
"Rachel, unlike Natalie, who was drawn to the mysteries hidden in the crannies of the world, preferred the comforts of familiar environments. Her adventures were more homely, more rooted in exploring depths within the known rather than seeking alien experiences in the unknown. She was an explorer too, but more of familiar spaces and places. An unveiled backyard mystery or a newly discovered hiking route near her town thrilled Rachel. Her adventurous spirit was more attuned to deepening connections with well-known territories, rather than establishing new ones in unexplored regions.\n"
"\n"
"On the other hand, Natalie was a true globetrotter at heart. Her sense of adventure thrived on the thrills of stepping into a new land, soaking in its heritage, welcoming its cultural flavors, and navigating through its labyrinthine streets. Every travel anecdote enriched her soul and fueled her craving for more such experiences. She was constantly looking at maps, tracing a finger along invisible routes, dreaming about future voyages. The world, in her eyes, was an open book she intended to read cover to cover. Foreign languages fascinated her, and exotic food stimulated her palate. \n"
"\n"
"In contrast, Rachel relished the feeling of being surrounded by the familiar chatter of her own language and savored traditional dishes cooked in her home's kitchen more than the finest overseas cuisines. Her spirit of adventure was not limited, it was just of a different kind, more intricate and deeply rooted in home ground.\n"
"\n"
"Rachel admired Natalie's passion for exploring foreign lands, and Natalie respected Rachel's devotion to finding beauty in the familiar. Their unique adventurous spirits took them down different paths, one toward the vastness of the globe, and the other delving deeper into a localized terrain. But, despite their contrasting preferences, their paths were entwined as they both sought to experience the world in their own ways, identifying the profound common thread between them – the joy of discovery and the expansion of their life's experiences. \n"
"\n"
"Yet, it was Natalie, with her boldly ambitious spirit for global exploration, who was more likely to leave her footprints on foreign shores. Her adventurous spirit became the compass, pointing her towards new horizons and uncharted territories. Therefore, when the question of traveling to a foreign country came up, everyone knew that it would be Natalie who would pack her bags first, ready to meet the world in its diversity and grandeur."

"In the near future, the world relies heavily on advanced virtual reality technology called the DreamNet for entertainment, communication, and work. Inside DreamNet, users can access different realms, each filled with opportunities to interact through vivid simulations and socialize with others - a lifeline to people during a time of strict government-imposed isolation due to a global pandemic.\n"
"\n"
"The protagonist, John Walker, is an ex-hacker and computer expert who has made a successful career creating realms within DreamNet, some of them for the government and deep-pocket enterprises. John becomes suspicious about a mysterious realm, \"The Abyss,\" which nobody seems to have access to or knowledge of but is rumoured to have monumental consequences on the real world. Intrigued by the forbidden nature and hidden secrets of the realm, John ventures into The Abyss, only to find himself trapped in a seemingly inescapable simulation that defies all known rules of the DreamNet.\n"
"\n"
"The world around John seems to bend and twist, causing his perception of time to become unreliable. \"Has John only been hanging in the net (the DreamNet) for a few minutes, or has it been hours?\" he wonders. Despite his skills and expertise, the simulation adapts to any effort he makes to escape, creating an endless loop of confusion and obliteration of his sense of reality.\n"
"\n"
"Along the way, John encounters other trapped users who have been lured into The Abyss. Together, they form a group to find a way out, all the while discovering terrifying secrets behind the simulation's purpose, which ties into a global conspiracy between powerful corporations and high-ranking government officials. Their goal is to use the DreamNet to gain total control over the human population by making people unable to discern the virtual world from the real world, hence creating subjects that are easy to manipulate and control.\n"
"\n"
"As John and his group dig deeper, they collect pieces of a puzzle that reveals the key to their escape lies at the heart of the simulation, a place called the \"Core Nexus.\" However, the closer they get to the Core Nexus, the more dangerous and surreal their experiences become, ultimately pushing each member to confront their deepest fears and vulnerabilities.\n"
"\n"
"In a climactic race against time, John and his team battle their way through The Abyss, cracking the code that would both grant them freedom and expose the sinister plot that lies beneath the DreamNet. They reach the Core Nexus and disable The Abyss, causing the entire realm and its simulations to come crashing down.\n"
"\n"
"Upon disconnecting from the DreamNet, John reports his findings to the authorities and exposes the conspiracy. The government and corporations involved are brought to justice, and preventative measures are taken, ensuring that no other similar atrocity can ever happen again.\n"

"Daniel Boone was of English and Welsh ancestry. Because the Gregorian calendar was adopted during his lifetime, Boone's birth date is sometimes given as November 2, 1734 (the \"New Style\" date), although Boone used the October date. The Boone family belonged to the Religious Society of Friends, called \"Quakers\", and were persecuted in England for their dissenting beliefs. Daniel's father, Squire (his first name, not a title) Boone (1696-1765) emigrated from the small town of Bradninch, Devon (near Exeter) to Pennsylvania in 1713, to join William Penn's colony of dissenters. Squire Boone's parents, George Boone III and Mary Maugridge, followed their son to Pennsylvania in 1717, and in 1720 built a log cabin at Boonecroft.  In 1720, Squire Boone, who worked primarily as a weaver and a blacksmith, married Sarah Morgan (1700-77). Sarah's family were Quakers from Wales, and had settled in 1708 in the area which became Towamencin Township of Montgomery County. In 1731, the Boones moved to Exeter Township in the Oley Valley of Berks County, near the modern city of Reading. There they built a log cabin, partially preserved today as the Daniel Boone Homestead. Daniel Boone was born there, November 2, 1734, the sixth of eleven children. The Daniel Boone Homestead is just four miles from the Mordecai Lincoln House, making the Squire Boone family neighbors of Mordecai Lincoln, the great, great grandfather of future President Abraham Lincoln. Mordecai's son, also named Abraham, married Ann Boone, a first cousin of Daniel.  Daniel Boone spent his early years on what was then the edge of the frontier. Several Lenape Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania Quakers had good relations with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. He learned to hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. Folk tales have often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys, when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his rifle and shot the predator through the heart just as it leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told so often that it became part of his popular image.  In Boone's youth, his family became a source of controversy in the local Quaker community when two of the oldest children married outside the endogamous community, in present-day Lower Gwynedd Township, Pennsylvania. In 1742, Boone's parents were compelled to publicly apologize after their eldest child, Sarah, married John Willcockson, a \"worldling\" (non-Quaker). Because the young couple had \"kept company\", they were considered \"married without benefit of clergy\". When the Boones' oldest son Israel married a \"worldling\" in 1747, Squire Boone stood by him. Both men were expelled from the Quakers; Boone's wife continued to attend monthly meetings with their younger children.\n"

If the man chooses the first route, how much longer will his trip be if all 3 stoplights are red?\n"

"[Answer]Maria's deduction for tax is 2000 x 20% = $400. Her deduction for insurance is 2000 x 5% = $100. Maria's total deductions is $400 + $100 = $500. After the deductions, Maria has only $2000 - $500 = $1500 left from her salary. Then, Maria pays $1500 / 4 = $375 for the utility bills.

"The missing first step in the process you described, which outlines the progression of an earthquake, is the accumulation of stress and strain within the Earth's crust due to tectonic forces. This comprehensive explanation of the process, including the missing first step, is provided below:\n"
"\n"
"1. Accumulation of stress and strain in the Earth's crust: The Earth's lithosphere is composed of a series of tectonic plates that are constantly moving due to processes such as subduction, rifting, and continental collision. As these plates interact with one another along their boundaries, stress accumulates within the Earth's crust. This stress is stored as potential energy, with the rocks in the crust becoming increasingly strained and deformed as the forces continue to act upon them. Over time, this strain builds up to a point where the rocks can no longer withstand the tectonic forces.\n"
"\n"
"2. The energy causes the fault lines to give way: Once the stress within the rocks has reached a critical level, the rocks can no longer maintain their strained state and they rupture, giving way along pre-existing fault lines or forming new ones in the process. This sudden release of stored energy takes the form of seismic waves that propagate through the Earth's crust, leading to the occurrence of an earthquake.\n"
"\n"
"3. The Earth's plates move: As the fractures along the fault lines widen, the tectonic plates shift along the fault plane, accommodating the movement that was prevented by the now-ruptured rocks. This movement can take the form of vertical, horizontal, or even diagonal displacement, depending on the type of fault and the specific tectonic forces acting on the region.\n"
"\n"
"4. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions: As the seismic waves generated by the rupture of the fault lines propagate through the Earth's crust, they spread out in all directions from the earthquake's source, also known as the hypocenter or focus. There are two types of seismic waves: body waves, which travel through the Earth's interior, and surface waves, which propagate along the surface of the Earth.\n"
"\n"
"5. The seismic waves shake the Earth as they move through it: As the seismic waves propagate through the Earth's crust, they cause the ground to shake and vibrate, resulting in the familiar shaking and often destructive effects of an earthquake. The intensity of shaking experienced at any given location depends on several factors, including the distance from the hypocenter, the type of seismic waves, the nature of the underlying geological materials, and local site conditions. Additionally, the release of energy at the fault can also generate secondary hazards, such as landslides, tsunamis, and ground liquefaction, all of which can compound the overall impact of an earthquake.\n"
"\n"
"In summary, the missing first step is the accumulation of stress and strain within the Earth's crust due to tectonic forces. This stress buildup eventually leads to rock failure and rupture, initiating the sequence of events that ultimately result in an earthquake and its associated shaking and secondary hazards."

"In a Cabinet designed to look like America, Zoe Baird, the Attorney General-designate, has the bearing and credentials of what America would like to look like. Personable and smart, experienced in the ways of the Justice Department and White House, Ms. Baird more than vindicates President-elect Clinton's determination to put a woman at the head of the Federal legal establishment.\n"
"\n"
"After weeks of churning, Mr. Clinton has succeeded in assembling a Cabinet of rare, welcome diversity. Just how rare can be judged by comparing it with President Bush's performance. Of 16 positions in the Cabinet, 11 are now held by white men, 3 by women, 1 by a black man and 1 by a Hispanic man. Of 16 nominees to Mr. Clinton's cabinet, 7 are white men, 4 are women, 4 are black (1 is a black woman) and 2 are Hispanic.\n"
"\n"
"Diversity, while it demonstrates respect for minority Americans, does not by itself assure distinction. Starting with Ms. Baird, the appointees Mr. Clinton announced yesterday give promise of capable public service.\n"
"\n"
"For instance, environmentalists were disappointed that Tim Wirth, a longtime champion of environmental causes, was passed over for Interior and Energy. But they can only be pleased with the appointment of Bruce Babbitt, the former Governor of Arizona and witty candidate for the 1988 Democratic Presidential nomination, as Secretary of the Interior.\n"
"\n"
"Federico Pena, designated as Transportation Secretary, brings experience as the Mayor of Denver who fought for construction of a massive new airport. Mickey Kantor, Mr. Clinton's campaign chairman, has had no special experience to qualify him as U.S. trade representative. But like Carla Hills, Mr. Bush's choice who has performed brilliantly, he is a shrewd lawyer and negotiator who knows politics and public service.\n"
"\n"
"The most impressive nomination yesterday was Ms. Baird's. In a field long dominated by men, she has more than held her own. She was comfortable in male-dominated law environments when she rendered scholarly advice to the White House and practicing at high levels of corporate law.\n"
"\n"
"Ms. Baird has the added advantage of being neither the President's crony nor sycophant. Compare that with the Attorneys General -- all of them -- of the Reagan-Bush years. William French Smith looked and acted like a society lawyer. Edwin Meese looked and acted like a harsh partisan. Richard Thornburgh looked promising but acted like a candidate for high office. And William Barr, the incumbent short-timer, has pandered eagerly to the White House.\n"
"\n"
"A decade ago, Mr. Smith defaulted on his duty to defend the Internal Revenue Service's right to deny tax exemptions to racially discriminatory schools. Ms. Baird was part of the team of private lawyers that stepped in and successfully did that job as friend of the court.\n"

"follow these steps below to successfully create a well-blended mixture. This process will require some basic kitchen tools and ingredients. Ensure you have gathered everything you need before starting.\n"
"\n"
"Ingredients:\n"
"1. Eggs\n"
"2. Oil (preferably a neutral oil like vegetable or canola oil)\n"
"3. Grapefruit juice (freshly squeezed or store-bought)\n"
"\n"
"Tools:\n"
"1. A whisk or electric mixer\n"
"2. A mixing bowl\n"
"3. A citrus juicer (if using fresh grapefruit)\n"
"4. A measuring cup\n"
"5. A spatula or spoon\n"
"6. A fork (if you don't have a whisk)\n"
"7. Paper towels or a clean cloth to clean up any spills\n"
"\n"
"Procedure:\n"
"\n"
"Step 1: Prepare the ingredients\n"
"If you are using fresh grapefruits, cut the grapefruits in half and use a citrus juicer to extract the juice. Strain the juice to remove any seeds or pulp.Measure out the required amount of grapefruit juice, eggs, and oil according to your recipe or desired quantity.\n"
"\n"
"Step 2: Break the eggs\n"
"Crack the eggs into the mixing bowl, making sure not to get any shell fragments into the bowl. If any shell pieces do end up in the bowl, use a spoon or your fingers to carefully remove them.\n"
"\n"
"Step 3: Whisk the eggs\n"
"Using the whisk, electric mixer, or a fork, beat the eggs until the yolks and whites are thoroughly combined and the mixture appears smooth and slightly frothy. This step is essential for ensuring a homogenous mixture when you add the other ingredients.\n"
"\n"
"Step 4: Add the grapefruit juice\n"
"Slowly pour the measured grapefruit juice into the bowl with the beaten eggs, while continually whisking or mixing. Make sure to mix thoroughly so that the juice is fully incorporated into the eggs. This will create a smooth, evenly blended liquid.\n"
"\n"
"Step 5: Add the oil\n"
"Gradually pour the oil into the egg and grapefruit juice mixture. While pouring, continue to whisk or mix the ingredients constantly. It's crucial to maintain a steady, vigorous mixing motion to ensure that the oil is appropriately emulsified and incorporated into the mixture. If you add the oil too quickly or do not mix well enough, the oil may not combine with the other ingredients, resulting in a separated mixture.\n"
"\n"
"Step 6: Check the consistency\n"
"Once you have combined all the ingredients, check the consistency of the mixture. It should be smooth and well-blended, with a slightly frothy appearance. If you observe any separation or uneven mixing, continue to whisk or mix until the mixture reaches the desired consistency.\n"
"\n"
"Step 7: Clean up\n"
"Wipe down any spills on your work area using paper towels or a clean cloth. Be sure to wash your tools and bowls promptly to avoid residue buildup, making them easier to clean.\n"
"\n"
"Step 8: Use the mixture\n"
"You can now use the blended mixture of eggs, oil, and grapefruit juice in your desired recipe. Some possible uses include salad dressings, marinades, baking, or as a unique base for smoothies.\n"
"\n"
"By following this method, you can successfully create a consistent and well-blended mixture of eggs, oil, and grapefruit juice. Practice your mixing skills and experiment with different quantities or ingredients to achieve various flavors and textures in your culinary creations."

"`Our Song' gives us the lives of the three teenagers Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn - best girlfriends hanging at the end of summer. Adolescent summer - even if we don't know the signals and landmarks of this particular terrain, Crown Heights, Brooklyn - is/was the same for us all. A lazy respite from the pressures and tumult of school. Welcome heat and idleness.\n"
"\n"
"But if this experience of adolescence is universal, the inner city of the 90s is a different place than most of us know - maybe as foreign a country as any. Young bodies carving new silhouettes...beckoning new territory...the maze towards adulthood. The young mind coming into itself, speaking for itself, saying this is who I am, this is who I want to try to be. It is/was always thus. But this is how it plays out in Brooklyn in the late 90s.\n"

"Jim McKay is the writer/director of this film project but he acknowledges all who have shouted suggestions at him. The opening title slide `A film by' seems to list everyone in the universe. It's a gesture but by the end of the film, we know it to be a genuine one. [The closing titles also have some of the most on-the-money and appreciative credits I've read.] The vivid sound recording by Jan McLaughlin deserves to be especially noted. McKay's a modest leader who knows who is telling this story - it's his three graces Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn. They're the real thing, their interactions have the fire of real friendship and the focus of reality. This ain't no music video shorthand telling of teenage life. It has the seriousness of the long unblinking stare.\n"
"\n"
"Hanging out with them, we don't quite feel included but we do feel privileged to be listening in. These are real voices speaking with plainness about the crises and dullness of daily life. We are witness to the modern math of teenage life - how its problems are interpreted, calculated and summed and solved. Small scenes illustrate large thoughts throughout. Lanisha hangs with her dad at his security job - it's the only way she gets to spend time with him. We see the love that exists between them but also the failures of family and fatherhood. In a connected scene, Lanisha defends her dad to her mom, and we see how desperately she needs to love them both and for them to love her in return. Later, the three friends lay in the dark sharing visions and dreams - and we remember how crazy/funny kids are and more tragically, how realism hammers idealism these days. And at the end, Maria simply walking down the street is a short story in itself. We see her gather up the courage to hold all her fears and doubts at bay. She demonstrates for us the strength one needs to have to be able to embrace the fragility that makes life livable.\n"
"\n"
"`Our Song's greatest gift is that we really feel deeply the terribly ephemeral nature of friendship - how, one day, alive and enlivening, that intimacy can, in the next, just turn and drift away. It's awful, but that's just the way it is, isn't it?\n"

"A Therapist Is Better at Handling Emotions Than You Are\n"
"\n"
"Impressive findings from the other side of the therapy couch: your therapist is better at regulating her emotions than you are, according to a small new study in the journal Psychotherapy.\n"
"\n"
"The authors wanted to see if psychotherapists are better at regulating emotion than the rest of us, so they tested experienced therapists as well as non-therapists by showing them pictures designed to elicit negative emotional reactions, ranging from slightly negative images like sad people to very intense images like corpses and people with severe injuries. After each image, they rated how negative the image made them feel.\n"
"\n"
"Both groups reacted the same way to the negative images.\n"
"\n"
"But differences emerged during the second part of the study, when people were shown the pictures again and told to use one of two techniques that regulates emotion: either positive reappraisal, in which you reinterpret emotional information in a positive light, or distraction—thinking about something unrelated and neutral in order to disengage from the negativity. Both have been shown to be effective against negative emotions.\n"
"\n"
"Therapists, the researchers found, were better at calming their emotional response by using these emotion regulation strategies than the non-therapists, regardless of which technique they chose.\n"
"\n"
"“It’s something they need for that job and something that makes them be effective in what they do,” says study author Jan Pletzer, a graduate student in business administration at Jacobs University Bremen in Germany and in social and organizational psychology at the VU University Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Next, Pletzer hopes to find out whether therapists come into their profession equipped with these emotional skills, or whether they hone them on the job.\n"
"\n"
"“I suspect maybe it’s a little bit of both,” says psychologist Mary Karapetian Alvord, PhD, adjunct associate professor at Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, who was not involved in the study. But just because non-therapists have less training doesn’t mean they’re doomed to be less emotionally intelligent than the professionals sitting across from them.\n"
"\n"
"We regulate our emotions through our thoughts, Alvord says—a key skill every good therapist learns how to do. “What lay people can do is really learn to catch your thoughts, be aware of your thoughts and recognize that those thoughts then lead to an emotional reaction and a physiological reaction,” she says. “Recognizing those connections is absolutely critical, and most people don’t. We think about emotions, but we don’t think about the thoughts and reframing and getting a different perspective.”\n"
"\n"
"When we do, she says, the effects can be huge on both our mind and body. Reframe a speedbump into a positive, and “immediately you recognize that your body relaxes, your muscles aren’t as tense, you feel better and you have a better outlook for the rest of the day,” Alvord says. “It’s something that therapists learn, to catch themselves.”"

"To evaluate the linguistic integrity of the given sentence - \"John disappeared\" - we must consider several aspects of language, including grammatical correctness, clarity of meaning, and adherence to the conventions of language that are generally accepted within the context of usage. Additionally, the linguistic integrity is influenced by the syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of the sentence.\n"
"\n"
"1. Grammar: The sentence \"John disappeared\" is grammatically correct. It contains a noun (John) as the subject, and a verb (disappeared) as the predicate. The subject-verb structure aligns with the rules of the English language. Also, the tense of the verb - simple past (disappeared) - is appropriate, indicating a completed action prior to the present moment.\n"
"\n"
"2. Clarity of Meaning: The meaning of the sentence is unambiguous. The reader or listener is likely to understand that the individual named 'John' is no longer present or has vanished. Ambiguity or confusion is minimized, resulting in a clear understanding of the intended message.\n"
"\n"
"3. Conventions of Language: \"John disappeared\" follows the standard conventions of English sentence construction. It employs appropriate capitalization and punctuation, as well as the correct use of parts of speech. The sentence is simple and concise, promoting understanding without the need for extraneous or complex elements.\n"
"\n"
"4. Syntax: The syntax of the given sentence is well-structured, as it arranges words and phrases in a manner that respects the rules of English grammar. The subject, 'John,' is a proper noun and precedes the predicate, 'disappeared,' a verb that correctly conveys the action of vanishing. The simple sentence does not include any additional clauses or phrases that might complicate the syntax.\n"
"\n"
"5. Semantics: In terms of semantics, the sentence employs meaningful words that function together to create a coherent message. The word 'disappeared' denotes the action of vanishing or becoming invisible, which correlates with the subject, 'John'. The combined meaning of 'John' (as a specific individual) and 'disappeared' (as a certain action) results in a meaningful sentence that builds a semantic connection between the words.\n"
"\n"
"6. Pragmatics: Pragmatically speaking, the sentence conveys a clear message that the intended audience should have no difficulty interpreting. The context in which the sentence appears may influence how the interpretation occurs; for example, if the sentence is featured in a mystery novel, 'John disappeared' may imply abduction or intentionality. However, the reader derives understanding from the sentence as it stands, potentially leading to additional context-based conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"In summary, the linguistic integrity of the sentence \"John disappeared\" is strong. It abides by the rules of grammar, exhibits clarity of meaning, adheres to the conventions of language, utilizes an appropriate syntax, displays semantic cohesion, and maintains pragmatically interpretability. Through these components, the sentence effectively communicates a message that most English speakers can easily understand and process."

Lil Jon bought them a car worth $30000, and Wynter presented them with a house worth four times the value of the car Lil Jon bought them. What was the total value of all the treats DJ Snake received on his engagement day?\n"
"[Answer]Moksi took DJ Snake and his fiancee to a luxurious hotel for two nights at $4000 per night, for a total of 2 * $4000 = $8000. If Lil Jon also bought them a car worth $30000, the value of the treats from Lil John and Moksi summed up to $8000 + $30000 = $38000. Wynter presented them with a house worth four times the value of the car Lil Jon bought them, a total of 4 * $30000 = $120000. The total value of all the treats DJ Snake received on his engagement day is $120000 + $38000 = $158000. The answer is 158000.\n"
"Q: Ethan is reading a sci-fi book that has 360 pages. He read 40 pages on Saturday morning and another 10 pages at night. The next day he read twice the total pages as on Saturday. How many pages does he have left to read?\n"
"A: Ethan read a total of 40 pages + 10 pages = 50 pages on Saturday. On the next day, he read a total of 50 pages x 2 = 100 pages. The total number of pages that Ethan had read is 50 pages + 100 pages = 150 pages. Therefore, Ethan has 360 pages - 150 pages = 210 pages left to read. The answer is 210.\n"

"Q: Gretchen's local ice cream shop offers 100 different flavors. She was able to try a 1/4 of the flavors 2 years ago and double that amount last year. How many more flavors will she need to try this year to have tried all 100 flavors?\n"
"A: The shop offers 100 flavors and she tried 1 / 4 of the flavors so she had 100 * .25 = 25 flavors 2 years ago. Last year she ate double the amount from the previous year so she had 25 * 2 = 50 flavors. 2 years ago she ate 25 flavors and last year she had 50 flavors so she has had 25 + 50 = 75 flavors. The shop offers 100 flavors and she has had 75 flavors so she still needs to try 100 - 75 = 25 flavors. The answer is 25.\n"

"So here’s something that won’t come as a surprise if you have season tickets for the Seattle Seahawks (the best football team in the known universe) or the Jacksonville Jaguars (the worst football team in the known universe): Good teams draw big crowds and bad teams draw small ones. That less-than forehead-smacking insight is what makes a new study in the business journal Applied Economics something shy of breaking news. According to the authors—economists from Nottingham University Business School and the University of Sheffield in Britain—the same rule holds for international cricket matches. And the headline of the press release announcing the study made no effort to conceal its sublimely obvious conclusion: “Strong teams attract crowds for international cricket,” it read.\n"
"\n"
"But science is often a far more nuanced thing than it seems—provided it’s properly explained. There is a rich and regrettable tradition among journals to promote studies that fall into the category science journalists alternately refer to as “blinding flashes of the obvious” or “The Annals of Duh.” Take “Causes of Death in Very Old People,” for instance. Um…I’m going to guess old age.\n"
"\n"
"Then there is this: “Blood Pressure Drugs Don’t Protect Against Colorectal Cancer”—though they may protect against, you know, high blood pressure. Or these: “Moderate Doses of Alcohol Increase Social Bonding in Groups” and “Dogs Learn to Associate Words With Objects Differently Than Humans Do.” If you already kind of guessed that people loosen up and feel friendlier when they’ve downed a shot or two, or that your dog can’t talk, you’d have been forgiven for giving these studies a pass.\n"
"\n"
"But under the no-news veneer of all of the studies, there was true news to be found. Blood pressure drugs reduce the output of norepinephrine and some animal studies have shown that that neurotransmitter encourages the growth of colorectal cancer cells, but that finding wasn’t holding up in people. While human babies tend to group objects by shape—so once they know a ball is round they will assume all round things are balls until they have reason to believe otherwise—dogs seem to use texture or size as their way of defining categories. Being dogs, they may never move beyond that point. And as for the cricket findings: previous economic studies had always concluded that it was the closeness of the contest—in which two evenly matched though not necessarily terrific teams were playing—rather than the excellence of the home team that determined crowd size. Nifty findings all—and none of which you’d know anything about if you didn’t read past the headline of the study.\n"
"\n"
"In a counterfactual age in which science is too often denied or ignored or carelessly shrugged off, it pays for the scientists themselves to consider all this. They no longer have the luxury of simply writing for other scientists—assuming, generally rightly, that that audience is sensitive to the nuance. They must, instead, write for all of us—the people who can best benefit from the science, if only we can understand it.\n"

He also hosted the successful revamp version of Card Sharks from 1986 to 1989. Eubanks received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his television work in 2000. The star is in front of Grauman's Egyptian Theatre, where Eubanks worked during the first years of his broadcasting career.\n"
"\n"
"Eubanks was born in Flint, Michigan, but was raised primarily in Pasadena, California, where he grew up listening to music, most notably favorites like Frank Sinatra and Doc Watson. His parents, John Otho Leland Eubanks (September 28, 1905 - April 11, 1995) and Gertrude Eubanks (nee McClure) (February 15, 1907 - July 24, 1997), were originally from Missouri. They moved to Flint during the Great Depression, where their only child was born, before moving on to California. The young boy became a child model, doing photo shoots for ads and meeting his idol, Gene Autry, when he was scheduled to do an ad photo shoot with him.  He watched popular classic television and quiz game shows. Also growing up in the 1940s and 1950s, he was influenced by Cary Grant, Howard Hughes, Buddy Hackett and Bill Cullen. He attended Pasadena High School, where he graduated in 1955. After graduation from high school, he would become one of California's most popular disc jockeys. In 1956, his first radio exposure was at KACY Radio in Oxnard, California. He joined KRLA in Pasadena in 1960 to do the overnight show. In the spring of 1962 he was promoted to morning drive, then a year later moved to his long-running 6-9pm evening slot. During most of the 1960s, he was also a producer of concerts, such as The Beatles 1964 and 1965 Hollywood Bowl performances, The Rolling Stones, during the first two years of the American tour. While still in Los Angeles, he also produced such artists as Barry Manilow, The Supremes, Dolly Parton, Bob Dylan, Elton John and Merle Haggard, among others. Eubanks attended Pierce College in the early 60s, according to his commentary on a Card Sharks episode.  Eubanks married Irma Brown, an avid athlete, ranch forewoman and artist, on September 10, 1969. They had three children: Trace, a retired firefighter; Corey, a stuntman; and Theresa. In 1970, the couple purchased a 20-acre (81,000 m2) portion of a working cattle ranch, and later expanded it to 26 acres (110,000 m2). The entire family enjoyed roping and riding, with Eubanks participating in rodeos during his spare time. Eubanks is a gold card member of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association. Irma handled interior decorating, landscaping, and mounting one to two equestrian shows a year. Irma died in 2002 after a prolonged illness.  Around 2004, Eubanks married Deborah James. James is a wedding/events coordinator in Ventura, California and has her own company, Bella Vita Events. The couple has a young son, Noah. In October 2010, Eubanks and his wife put their Westlake Village, CA home on the market.\n"

"Beyonce Giselle Knowles was born in Houston, Texas, to Celestine \"Tina\" Knowles (nee Beyince), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager. Beyonce's name is a tribute to her mother's maiden name. Beyonce's younger sister Solange is also a singer and a former back up dancer for Destiny's Child.\n"
"\n"
"Jody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as \"one of the most compelling instruments in popular music\". Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\". Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyonce's unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was \"capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.\"  Beyonce's music is generally R&B, but she also incorporates pop, soul and funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated Beyonce's exploration of 1990s-style R&B, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases. While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyonce recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyonce was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.  She has received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded with Destiny's Child and her solo efforts. Her early songs were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like \"Independent Women\" and \"Survivor\", but after the start of her relationship with Jay-Z, she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as \"Cater 2 U\". Beyonce has also received co-producing credits for most of the records in which she has been involved, especially during her solo efforts. However, she does not formulate beats herself, but typically comes up with melodies and ideas during production, sharing them with producers.  In 2001, she became the first black woman and second female lyricist to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Pop Music Awards. Beyonce was the third woman to have writing credits on three number one songs (\"Irreplaceable\", \"Grillz\" and \"Check on It\") in the same year, after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. She is tied with American lyricist Diane Warren at third with nine song-writing credits on number-one singles. (The latter wrote her 9/11-motivated song \"I Was Here\" for 4.) In May 2011, Billboard magazine listed Beyonce at number 17 on their list of the \"Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters\", for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She was one of only three women on that list, along with Alicia Keys and Taylor Swift.\n"

"Summarize the following:\n"
"You don't have to go this road alone. Even if you don't make business partnerships with your loved ones (which can be a smart idea), you can lean on these people in the beginning (and later, when times are hard). Family and friends can offer powerful emotional support during your entrepreneurial journey. When you're stressed to your limit, this support can make the difference between pushing yourself to succeed and throwing into the well.  Talk to your family and make sure they agree with your overall business plan, because you may, at times, have to tax your family's resources, time, money, health, and nerves. It's only fair that they know what they're getting in to. After becoming the boss in your business life, you may feel the temptation to become bossy at home, too. Don't act on this temptation. Keep your business concerns and your family concerns separate - make a rule that you won't discuss your business at dinner, for instance. Having sound knowledge of commercial law (especially contract law, tax law, and the legal requirements for running a small business) is a valuable skill for an entrepreneur to have. If possible, it's a great idea to familiarize yourself with these areas of law, before starting your business. If you're truly confident in these areas of law, you can save money, you, otherwise may have had to spend on legal counsel. You'll also spare yourself from serious headaches when trying to decipher complex business and tax documents.  However, if you're  not  familiar with the law, get help. The money you spend on a lawyer can save you many times your initial investment, for instance, by preventing you from getting into damaging contracts. If you lose your health, you may lose it all. A healthy body, mind, and soul are vital to success as a business owner. Especially in the beginning, the hours may be  very  long and the work may be  very  hard. Still, you should always try to devote reasonable amounts of time to exercise, sleep, and \"down-time.\" Treat these things with the value they deserve - they keep you healthy and sane. Remember, if you're incapacitated, you can't run your business. Try to get income protection insurance, especially if your job is one with a risk of injury - a self-employed person cannot afford to lose income to this possibility. Do all things in moderation. Live life with a sense of balance, even when you're starting a business with barely a cent in the bank.  Losing your perspective in life will make you poorer in the long run (emotionally - not necessarily financially), so it's never a risk worth taking.  Never miss a night’s sleep. Don't work yourself to death. Always devote time to your family, your hobbies, and, of course, yourself. Your life should be a source of joy and passion - not just an opportunity to work. Additionally, you should never rely on drugs to aid your performance ability or to replace your regular healthy eating and exercise plans.  This will, in the long run, break you down and cause you to make irrational, emotional decisions which are never a good thing in business."

"Title: Deadline 5 A.M. \n"
"\n"
"Plot: \n"
"\n"
"The movie starts in the bustling city of New York where our protagonist, Jake Donovan - a genius, yet somewhat carefree, coder working in a booming tech startup, is busy writing code lines for their really ambitious AR (Augmented Reality) project. Jake's life is casual, involving coding during the day, frequent banter with his colleagues, countless cups of coffee, and occasional card games in the evening at their favorite hangout place. \n"
"\n"
"One day, Jake's company is tasked by renowned and wealthy tech entrepreneur, Maxwell Sinclair, with a highly secretive project - The Final Table. The project stirs up interest within the tech community due to Sinclair's cryptic remarks about how it will change the world. Jake's team is chosen for the project, with a shattering deadline just 11 days away at 5 A.M. \n"
"\n"
"The plot thickens as Jake and his team dive headfirst into the project. Each day, they encounter hurdles and experience moments of breakthrough. The movie encapsulates these chaotic days and sleepless nights fabulously while also building up each character, their motivations, and internal dynamics. Throughout this, Jake becomes particularly engrossed in the complexity of The Final Table.\n"
"\n"
"Despite initial delays and disagreements, they all push their limits to meet the deadline, only to discover that The Final Table is much more than a tech project. It's a doomsday device capable of inducing realistic mass hallucinations through AR, effectively capable of controlling the entire human population. Sinclair's corporative image is just a façade to his nefarious plan of global dominance.\n"
"\n"
"The team is shocked and utterly torn between their morally correct path and their professional obligation towards the project. The climax builds up as Jake decides not to let Sinclair implement his dystopian plan. \n"
"\n"
"While simultaneously working on the project, Jake and his associates stealthily work on an antithesis to the device. With the deadline approaching, tension grows as both Sinclair and Jake race against time - one to take over the world, and one to save it, all leading up to the unforgettable 5 A.M.\n"
"\n"
"As the deadline arrives, Sinclair, who has been monitoring the team's progress, is ready to activate The Final Table. But right as he is about to start it, Jake and his team activate the antithesis device, which hijacks Sinclair's system and sends it into a destructive loop. \n"
"\n"
"Just when Sinclair realizes what transpires, it's too late. The Final Table crashes and falls apart even before it starts. Sinclair is arrested as the evidence against his malicious intent surfaces, and Jake and his team are hailed as unsung heroes.\n"
"\n"
"The film culminates in an emotional climax as Jake submits the project report of The Final Table to his boss with, ironically, the remark \"Project Completed\". The movie ends there, leaving audiences with a feeling of closure and a lingering thought about the misuse of technology in wrong hands. \n"
"\n"
"Deadline 5 A.M. would be a nail-biting techno-thriller with underlying themes of teamwork, courage, and the ethical use of technology."

"LE GRAND VOYAGE is a gentle miracle of a film, a work made more profound because of its understated script by writer/director Ismaël Ferroukhi who allows the natural scenery of this 'road trip' story and the sophisticated acting of the stars Nicolas Cazalé and Mohamed Majd to carry the emotional impact of the film. Ferroukhi's vision is very capably enhanced by the cinematography of Katell Djian (a sensitive mixture of travelogue vistas of horizons and tightly photographed duets between characters) and the musical score by Fowzi Guerdjou who manages to maintain some beautiful themes throughout the film while paying homage to the many local musical variations from the numerous countries the film surveys. \n"
"\n"
"Reda (Nicolas Cazalé) lives with his Muslim family in Southern France, a young student with a Western girlfriend who does not seem to be following the religious direction of his heritage. His elderly father (Mohamed Majd) has decided his time has come to make his Hadj to Mecca, and being unable to drive, requests the reluctant Reda to forsake his personal needs to drive him to his ultimate religious obligation. The two set out in a fragile automobile to travel through France, into Italy, and on through Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, and Turkey to Saudi Arabia. Along the trip Reda pleads with his father to visit some of the interesting sights, but his father remains focused on the purpose of the journey and Reda is irritably left to struggle with his father's demands. On their pilgrimage they encounter an old woman (Ghina Ognianova) who attaches herself to the two men and must eventually be deserted by Reda, a Turkish man Mustapha (Jacky Nercessian) who promises to guide the father/son duo but instead brings about a schism by getting Reda drunk in a bar and disappearing, and countless border patrol guards and custom agents who delay their progress for various reasons. Tensions between father and son mount: Reda cannot understand the importance of this pilgrimage so fraught with trials and mishaps, and the father cannot comprehend Reda's insensitivity to the father's religious beliefs and needs. At last they reach Mecca where they are surrounded by hoards of pilgrims from all around the world and the sensation of trip's significance is overwhelming to Reda. The manner in which the story comes to a close is touching and rich with meaning. It has taken a religious pilgrimage to restore the gap between youth and old age, between son and father, and between defiance and acceptance of religious values. \n"
"\n"
"The visual impact of this film is extraordinary - all the more so because it feels as though the camera just 'happens' to catch the beauty of the many stopping points along the way without the need to enhance them with special effects. Nicolas Cazalé is a superb actor (be sure to see his most recent and currently showing film 'The Grocer's Son') and it is his carefully nuanced role that brings the magic to this film. Another fine film from The Film Movement, this is a tender story brilliantly told. Highly recommended. \n"

"Pumpkin pie may be native to North America, but we Aussies think it’s ripper, too. Our special seasonal Noosa Pumpkin yoghurt is a “hats off” to this beaut of a traditional dessert. Natural pumpkin puree, warm, rich spices, and our famously thick and velvety yoghurt—it’s a sweet, spicy holiday shindig for your tastebuds. ||||| Chicago, September 22, 2015 — It’s that time a year again for falling leaves, football games, and the annual tradition of limited-time offer (LTO) pumpkin specialty drinks. Turns out that it’s one of the favorite times of the year for foodservice operators who offer the limited time drinks because their business benefits in more ways than one, reports The NPD Group, a leading global information company. \n"
"  \n"
" The seasonal beverage offers can spur additional purchases by established customers, bring in new customers, draw customers from competitors, and stimulate business during slow periods, according to research from NPD’s Checkout Tracking™, which harvests receipts from more than 35,000 diners to track consumer purchase behavior. An analysis of the purchase cycle of pumpkin spice latte buyers reveals that these lattes are likely considered to be an “indulgent�? purchase, and the vast majority of these purchasers, 72 percent, did so just once. About 20 percent of pumpkin spice latte customers purchased the item twice, and about 8 percent made three or more purchases during the offer period. \n"
"  \n"
" In addition to increasing visits and visit frequency, seasonal beverages also produce higher checks, NPD found. During fall and winter 2014, the average check for pumpkin latte buyers was $7.81, compared with $6.67 for non-buyers. Similarly, the average check for buyers of a white mocha, another popular seasonal beverage, was $8.37, compared with just $6.84 for non-buyers. Consumers’ purchase of food items in addition to the beverage contributed to the higher check average, according to the Checkout Tracking analysis. \n"
"  \n"
" To determine the impact of limited-time offers on visit frequency, NPD also examined the purchase cycle of a seasonal shake offer at another major chain. The data revealed that these shake purchasers tended to be the restaurant’s most loyal customers, with higher purchase frequency rates, especially during the promotional period. Shake buyers made 5.7 visits in the two-month period before the limited-time offer, and then made an additional visit during the limited-time offer period. Meanwhile non-shake buyers made only 4.7 visits prior to the promotion and 4.4 visits during the limited-time offer. \n"
"  \n"
" “Considering the battle for traffic share in the restaurant industry, it’s critical to offer unique, craveable menu items that attract both new customers and keep current ones coming back,�? says Bonnie Riggs, NPD restaurant industry analyst. “For the restaurant operator, seasonal beverages have a positive impact on visit frequency and check averages as consumers tend to purchase food along with the seasonal beverage. It doesn’t get much better than that.�? \n"

"Step 1: Identify the genre and time period\n"
"First, we need to determine the genre of our movie. In this case, we will go with a crime thriller/mystery, as it fits perfectly with the murder plotline. The movie will be set in present day, to allow for modern forensic technology and detective methods.\n"
"\n"
"Step 2: Create main characters\n"
"The next step is creating our main characters. We will have:\n"
"Detective Smith - The lead detective on the Ames murder case, fairly experienced and well-respected in the detective community.\n"
"Ames - The victim of the murder. Wealthy businessman with a complicated past and a list of potential enemies.\n"
"Laura - Ames' estranged wife, a possible suspect in the case.\n"
"Jacob - Ames' business partner, another potential suspect.\n"
"Rachel - Ames' personal assistant, who discovers the body and appears to know more than she's letting on.\n"
"\n"
"Step 3: Establish the setting\n"
"The movie will take place in a metropolitan city with a mix of high-end affluence and a gritty underworld. This contrast will help set the stage for the crime as well as build tension in the unfolding investigation.\n"
"\n"
"Step 4: Develop the plot\n"
"\n"
"Act 1 - Introduce the characters and murder\n"
"Detective Smith is called to the crime scene, where Ames has been found dead in his luxurious apartment. It appears that Ames was killed by a gunshot wound to the chest. Smith interviews Rachel, who is visibly distraught, and gathers preliminary information about Ames. Smith contacts Laura and Jacob, who come separately to the apartment.\n"
"\n"
"Act 2 - Delve into the suspects and their motives\n"
"Detective Smith begins to investigate the motives of Laura, Jacob, and Rachel. Laura and Ames had a tumultuous relationship and were in the middle of a contentious divorce. Jacob was struggling with the failing business partnership and had financial motive for Ames' death. Rachel is revealed to be secretly in love with Ames and harboring a terrible secret about him. The tension builds as Smith struggles to find concrete evidence pointing to any one person.\n"
"\n"
"Act 3 - The twist and the reveal\n"
"Detective Smith discovers a hidden room in Ames' apartment, filled with incriminating materials suggesting Ames was involved in a criminal organization. Rachel, in a moment of vulnerability, confesses to Smith that she knew about Ames' illegal dealings but claims she would never have hurt him. Smith uncovers that Jacob had a secret connection to Ames' criminal past and was the one who tipped off Ames' enemies, resulting in his murder.\n"
"\n"
"Act 4 - The climax and resolution\n"
"Detective Smith confronts Jacob with the evidence, and Jacob confesses to his role in Ames' murder. However, Laura finds out about the confrontation, and in a desperate attempt to protect her own financial interests, she kills Jacob. The movie ends with Laura's arrest and Smith's reflection on the complex world of justice, greed, and personal secrets that led to Ames' murder.\n"
"\n"
"By following these four steps, we created a thrilling movie plot centered on Ames' murder that involves elements of suspense, mystery, and unexpected twists that both entertain and engage the audience."

"Following their bye week, the Patriots traveled to Buffalo to play the Bills, who had won 5 of 7 since their 38-7 Week 3 loss to the Patriots. On the first drive of the game, Gay intercepted Losman to give the Patriots the ball at the Bills' 21-yard line. Two plays later, Maroney ran it in from 6&#160;yards out for a Patriots touchdown. After a Bills punt, the Patriots increased their lead to 14-0 after a 43-yard touchdown reception by Moss from Brady. The touchdown, Moss' 13th on the season, broke Stanley Morgan's franchise record of 12 touchdown passes in a single season. On the ensuing drive, a Green strip-sack of Losman was recovered by the Bills, and two plays later, Roscoe Parrish caught a 47-yard touchdown pass for the only Bills touchdown of the game. The Patriots' next drive went for 72&#160;yards and ended in a 16-yard Moss touchdown reception on the first play of the second quarter. A Bills punt on their next possession gave the Patriots the ball at their own 16-yard line. Aided by catches of 25, 15, 11, and 10&#160;yards by Watson, Welker, Stallworth, and Faulk respectively, the Patriots drove 84&#160;yards in under 7&#160;minutes, capping off the drive with a 6-yard touchdown reception to Moss. That touchdown gave Brady the most career touchdown passes in Patriots franchise history, breaking Steve Grogan's record of 182. Another Bills punt led to the Patriots' fifth possession and fifth touchdown of the half, this time a 17-yard Moss touchdown catch ended another 72-yard drive. Moss' fourth touchdown of the half tied an NFL record for touchdowns for a single player before halftime, and set the Patriots' franchise record for touchdowns by a player in a game. Adalius Thomas also had 2.5 sacks in the half, setting a single-game career high. The Patriots began the second half where they left off in the first, driving 73&#160;yards in more than 6&#160;minutes for another touchdown, this one a 3-yard reception by Watson. The Bills responded with a 29-yard Terrence McGee kickoff return that led to a 52-yard Rian Lindell field goal to cut the Patriots lead to 42-10. The Patriots' next series, their seventh of the game, also ended in their seventh touchdown of the game, setting a Patriots franchise single-season touchdown record (1961 and 1980, 52). A Welker screen pass went 24&#160;yards to put the Patriots in the Bills' red zone, and a 1-yard Eckel touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter gave the Patriots a 49-10 lead. On the second play of the Bills' next drive, Sanders forced a fumble by running back Dwayne Wright after a 5-yard reception, which Hobbs recovered and returned 35&#160;yards for the Patriots' eighth and final touchdown of the game. The Patriots' 56 points tied a franchise record, and were the most points scored by a road team in the NFL since 1973. Their 46-point scoring margin was also the second-largest in team history. The Patriots' 56-10 win brought their record to 10-0, the tenth time since 1970 a team started a season 10-0.\n"

"Both questions are essentially asking for the same information. They are paraphrases of each other, as they both inquire about the most reliable full-size American pickup truck available. To answer the question briefly, it would be difficult to make a definitive statement, as reliability tends to vary across different models and years. However, by analyzing various studies and reviews, one can often gain a better understanding of the general reliability trends among the full-size American pickup truck market.\n"
"\n"
"Now, to provide a more detailed and long answer to the question:\n"
"\n"
"In order to determine which full-size American pickup truck is the most reliable, we must first define our parameters. In this case, we will consider trucks from the three major American automakers: Ford, General Motors (Chevrolet/GMC), and RAM (formerly a Dodge brand). We will also evaluate them based on surveys, studies, and expert reviews for long-term reliability and dependability.\n"
"\n"
"1. Ford F-Series\n"
"The Ford F-Series, particularly the F-150 model, has been America's best-selling pickup truck for decades. Known for their solid construction and dependable performance, F-Series trucks have earned a reputation for being reliable workhorses. In recent years, Ford has added numerous technology and safety features, further enhancing their appeal. J.D. Power's 2020 Vehicle Dependability Study ranked the Ford F-150 as the most reliable truck in the Large Light Duty Pickup segment.\n"
"\n"
"2. Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra\n"
"Chevrolet and GMC, both subsidiaries of General Motors, often share platforms for their pickup trucks, such as the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. Both models are generally known for their durability and longevity, although some model years have faced reliability issues. In J.D. Power's 2020 Vehicle Dependability Study, the Chevrolet Silverado ranked second, behind the Ford F-150, in the Large Light Duty Pickup segment.\n"
"\n"
"3. RAM 1500\n"
"The RAM 1500 has experienced a significant improvement in recent years, with a complete overhaul of its design and engineering. While previously lagging behind Ford and Chevrolet in many areas, including quality, the latest generation of RAM trucks has garnered impressive reviews from experts and owners alike. The RAM 1500 earned top honors in J.D. Power's 2020 Initial Quality Study, ranking first in the Large Light Duty Pickup segment. However, long-term reliability remains to be seen as these models have not been on the market for an extensive period.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, it is challenging to declare a clear winner in the most reliable full-size American pickup truck category, as each manufacturer has models with varying levels of reliability. That said, the Ford F-150 generally earns high marks for dependability, with the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra not far behind. The RAM 1500 has shown significant promise in recent years, but its long-term reliability has yet to be firmly established. Buyers should consider factors such as individual needs, budget, and model-year-specific reliability ratings when making their purchasing decisions."

"Title: The Magna Carta of Baseball: Documents Sell for $3.3 Million, Rewriting Baseball's History and Crediting Doc Adams as the True Father of the Sport\n"
"\n"
"The Magna Carta of Baseball, a collection of 1857 documents known as the \"Laws of Base Ball,\" has been sold for an astounding $3.3 million at auction—an event that has sent shockwaves through the world of baseball and its historians. The documents, which not only hold great monetary value but are also historically profound, were auctioned off to an anonymous buyer after two weeks of bidding. Although the auction house had predicted a sales price of over $1 million, the final tally far exceeded expectations, leaving many in awe of the significance of these critical papers.\n"
"\n"
"However, it wasn't always clear just how valuable these documents were. In 1999, their owner, who remains anonymous, purchased the papers in Texas for a mere $12,000, unaware of the stories they would soon reveal. It was only when the auction house appraised these papers that their true significance became clear—the documents shed new light on the early history of baseball, crediting Daniel Lucius \"Doc\" Adams as the father of the modern game and placing the birth of baseball three years earlier than previously believed.\n"
"\n"
"Daniel Lucius \"Doc\" Adams, a figure who may not have been as well-known as other supposed pioneers of the game, such as Abner Doubleday and Alexander Cartwright, now takes his rightful place as the key player in the inception and development of baseball as we know it today. It was Adams who set the foundation for the modern game with his vision and his tireless efforts in the mid 19th-century. He thoroughly developed the sport, overseeing countless rule changes, equipment improvements, and even the very design of the baseball field.\n"
"\n"
"The sale of the Laws of Base Ball not only made headlines for the substantial sum it commanded but also for the historical revelations brought forth as a result of the auction. The discovery of these documents has most assuredly rewritten the history of the game, placing baseball's dawn three years earlier than previously thought. This information reshapes our understanding of baseball's growth as a truly American sport, evolving from its English predecessors like rounders and cricket to take on a unique identity that would come to define American pastimes for generations to come.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the sale of the Magna Carta of Baseball serves as a shining example of the importance of historical documents in shaping not only the past of the sports we love but also providing a greater understanding of the present and the sports' development over time. The auction has elevated Daniel Lucius \"Doc\" Adams to his rightful position as the true father of modern baseball, and the documents' astonishing value serves to strengthen the passion and love for one of America's most storied sports. With the Laws of Base Ball now in the hands of a collector, it is a powerful reminder that our evolution as a society is continuously influenced and shaped by history—and sometimes that history can be worth millions."

"A human would choose \"crowding\" to answer the question above due to several reasons that are specifically related to the nature of narrow halls in museums and the implications of such a layout on the overall visitor experience.\n"
"\n"
"First, narrow halls are spaces with limited width, which directly affects the movement and accessibility of people within that area. When a museum exhibits its artifacts or artworks, visitors will naturally gravitate towards those halls as part of their experience. As more people congregate in the narrow halls, the available space for each person diminishes, leading to a feeling of crowding. In this context, crowding is the perception of physical discomfort due to the reduced personal space, which amplifies as more visitors enter the area.\n"
"\n"
"Second, museums are often popular tourist destinations that attract locals and foreigners alike. During peak seasons or special exhibitions, a significant influx of visitors can be expected. When this happens, the narrow halls are even more susceptible to congestion and overcrowding. This may result in longer waiting times to view the displays, limited capacity to appreciate the details, and, possibly, queues to enter the area. Consequently, the overall atmosphere may become somewhat unpleasant and suffocating.\n"
"\n"
"Third, crowding can also affect the social interactions and dynamics in the museum. In a crowded narrow hall, visitors may inadvertently bump into each other, cross each other's path, or block each other's view. This could create frustration and tensions among the visitors and could lead to conflicts or misunderstandings. Additionally, visitors may feel a stronger need for personal space, consequently limiting the opportunity for meaningful conversations about the exhibits.\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, crowded narrow halls can impact the overall satisfaction, engagement, and learning experiences of museum-goers. Having to navigate through a densely packed space can be mentally exhausting and might cause some visitors to feel overwhelmed or anxious. Studies have shown that discomfort and negative feelings associated with crowding can overshadow the potential benefits of visiting a museum, such as learning, aesthetic pleasure, and engaging with history.\n"
"\n"
"The other options mentioned - sore feet, amazement, retrospection, and boredom - might also hold true for some visitors in a particular context, but they are less likely to be directly linked to the architectural feature of narrow halls. Sore feet could result from walking around a museum, regardless of the width of the halls, while amazement, retrospection, and boredom are largely determined by personal interest and engagement with the exhibits, rather than the physical dimensions of the space.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, a human would choose \"crowding\" as the answer to the question, as the presence of narrow halls in museums could result in discomfort, reduced personal space, and hindered accessibility owing to the high concentration of visitors in a limited area. This subsequently affects their overall satisfaction, engagement, and learning experiences during their visit."

The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: $11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a $115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty.

Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA. \n"

"has decided to take control of his health and fitness by incorporating a well-rounded workout routine into his daily life. After spending months researching different types of exercise and consulting with fitness professionals, he has come up with a plan that includes a mix of strength training, cardiovascular activities, and flexibility exercises.\n"
"\n"
"As he sits on the black mat, he mentally prepares himself for the upcoming workout session. He starts by visualizing his goals and the improvements that he wants to see in terms of his strength, stamina, and physique. He understands that these changes won't happen overnight, but he is committed to making a sustained effort and remaining consistent with his workout schedule.\n"
"\n"
"Once he feels mentally ready, the man begins his warm-up routine, which is crucial for preventing injuries and preparing the muscles for more intense activities. He starts with some light stretching, focusing on the major muscle groups such as the hamstrings, quads, and upper body. After spending some time gently stretching the muscles, he transitions into a series of dynamic warm-up movements, including jumping jacks, high knees, and butt kicks to elevate his heart rate and enhance blood circulation.\n"
"\n"
"Now that his body is primed for action, the man begins his strength training workout, targeting various muscle groups to ensure a balanced approach. He performs a combination of compound and isolation exercises such as squats, deadlifts, chest presses, and bicep curls, carefully tracking the number of sets and repetitions to monitor his progress. While engaging in these exercises, the man is mindful of proper form and technique to maximize results and minimize the risk of injury.\n"
"\n"
"Between sets, he uses the black mat to perform core-strengthening exercises like planks and bicycle crunches, aiming to tighten his abdominal muscles and increase stability. He knows that a strong core is the foundation of a well-functioning and injury-resistant body.\n"

"After completing his strength training, the man transitions into a cardiovascular workout. He alternates between running on the treadmill, cycling on a stationary bike, and climbing on the stair-master. These activities increase his heart rate, improve his stamina, and burn calories, contributing to overall weight loss and a healthier heart.\n"

"It also said it was \"committed to the study of languages for professional life\".\n"
"But in the letter to UU's vice-chancellor Professor Paddy Nixon, seen by the BBC, the nine academic staff in the university's modern language department warned: \"Our reputation at a whole series of levels will be further damaged when the Confucius Institute, in the bid for which we showed unwavering commitment to the promotion of modern languages, is withdrawn from us, as inevitably it must, and relocated elsewhere in NI.\"\n"
"They also said the decision to close the school will cause \"enormous damage\" and expressed concern about how existing students will be able to finish their degrees.\n"

"Q: Facebook decided to award a productivity bonus to all its female employees who are mothers. This productivity bonus will total 25% of Facebook's annual earnings, which was $5,000,000 for the year 2020. It is known that Facebook employs 3300 employees; one-third are men, and of the women, 1200 are not mothers. How much was the bonus that each female mother employee received, assuming each one received an equal amount?\n"
"A: 25% of Facebook's annual earnings is 25 / 100 * $5,000,000 = $1,250,000. The number of male employees is 3300 * 1 / 3 = 1100. So, the number of female employees is 3300 - 1100 = 2200. The number of female employees who are not moms is 2200 - 1200 = 1000. So the amount to be distributed to each mother would be $1,250,000 / 1000 = $1250. The answer is 1250.\n"
"Question: Ted needs to purchase 5 bananas and 10 oranges. If bananas cost $2 each and oranges cost $1.50 each. How much money does Ted need to purchase 5 bananas and 10 oranges?\n"
"Answer: Ted needs 5 bananas and they each cost $2. To purchase the bananas, Ted needs 5 * 2 = 10 dollars. Because Ted needs 10 oranges and they each cost $1.50, Ted needs 10 * 1.5 = 15 dollars to pay for the oranges. All together Ted needs $10 for the bananas and $15 for the oranges, so combined Ted needs 10 + 15 = 25 dollars to purchase all the produce. The answer is 25.\n"

"Question: Benjamin is tracking how many miles he walks in a week. He walks to work and home five days a week, walks his dog twice a day every day, walks to his best friend’s house once a week, and walks to the convenience store twice a week. Work is six miles away, dog walks are two miles, his best friend’s house is one mile, and the convenience store is three miles. How many miles does Benjamin walk in a week?\n"
"Answer: Benjamin walks 6 miles to work and 6 miles home, so he walks 6 * 2 = 12 miles to work and home. He walks to work 5 days a week, so he walks 12 * 5 = 60 miles to work and home a week. He walks his dog 2 times a day for 2 miles, so he walks 2 * 2 = 4 miles a day for his dog. He walks his dog 7 days a week, so he walks 4 * 7 = 28 miles for his dog. He walks 3 miles to the store 2 times a week, so he walks 2 * 3 = 6 miles to the store each week. Adding his weekly 1 mile to his friend’s house, Benjamin walks 60 + 28 + 6 + 1 = 95 miles in a week. The answer is 95.\n"

"Dalton's law of partial pressures has been a fundamental concept in chemistry and physics since its introduction. However, despite its great importance, there were some limitations and problems associated with Dalton's original laws, which evolved over time in response to scientific advancements and a better understanding of gas behavior. Some of the issues were:\n"
"\n"
"1. Limited to ideal gases: One of the primary issues with Dalton's law is that it is based solely on ideal gas behavior, which assumes that the molecules of a gas have negligible volume and no intermolecular forces. This idealization is not valid in real gas systems, especially at high pressures and low temperatures, where the volume of gas molecules and intermolecular forces become significant. Consequently, the law fails to accurately describe the behavior of real gas mixtures under these conditions.\n"
"\n"
"2. Inapplicable to reactive gases: Although Dalton's law holds true for non-reactive gases, it is not accurate for mixtures containing reactive gases. When gases react chemically, their individual partial pressures may change due to the formation of new compounds or the consumption of reactants, invalidating the assumption that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of individual gases.\n"
"\n"
"3. Incomplete account for non-ideal behavior: The original formulation of Dalton's law does not comprehensively address deviations from ideal gas behavior. Van der Waals, a Dutch physicist, later improved our understanding of this limitation in gas behavior by introducing the Van der Waals equation. This equation applies corrections for gas molecule volume and intermolecular forces and provides a more accurate description of real gas systems.\n"
"\n"
"4. Ignorance of molecular collisions: Dalton's law assumes that gas molecules move in straight lines between collisions with the container walls and do not interact with each other. However, this is an oversimplification for real gases, as molecules do collide with one another, which influences gas behavior and properties. The kinetic-molecular theory of gases, developed later, offers a more comprehensive understanding of gas behavior by considering molecular collisions in its descriptions.\n"
"\n"
"5. Influence of gas dissolution: Dalton's law does not account for the possibility of gas dissolution in liquids, such as when different gases dissolve in blood. This phenomenon can affect the gas behavior and properties, leading to potential deviations from the predictions of Dalton's law.\n"
"\n"
"Despite these limitations and problems associated with Dalton's original laws, they have made significant contributions to the scientific understanding of gas behavior. Many advancements (such as the Van der Waals equation and the kinetic-molecular theory) have built upon this foundation, helping refine and extend our knowledge of gases and their properties. In conclusion, Dalton's law of partial pressures is an essential concept that has aided the development of chemistry and physics, while recognizing its limitations has led to further research and improved understanding of gas behavior."

"his responsibility as the diligent paperboy in their small suburban neighborhood. Nick, an avid reader, always looked forward to receiving the latest edition of the daily newspaper to catch up on current events, local stories, sports results, and the funnies. Ensuring that this connection to the outside world was constantly and promptly maintained was the backbone of Randy's commitment to his job.\n"
"\n"
"Randy was well-known and respected in the community, not just for his dedication to his work as a paperboy, but also for his friendly and approachable nature. He made an effort to familiarize himself with the neighbors, always offering a warm smile and a wave as he rode by on his trusty bicycle. The path he took through the neighborhood was well-trodden and remained consistent, rain or shine. This was a testament to the importance Randy placed on his role in delivering the newspaper to the community.\n"
"\n"
"For Nick, the newspaper was more than just a source of news – it represented his connection to the broader world and played an essential role in maintaining his informed status. As an early riser, he would eagerly wait for the familiar sound of Randy's bicycle brakes as they screeched to a halt in front of his house. Before Nick could even open his door, Randy would expertly toss the newspaper perfectly wrapped in a plastic cover onto Nick's porch, anticipating inclement weather to keep the paper pristine. Nick appreciated not only the delivery but also the additional care and thought that Randy put into his work.\n"
"\n"
"Their connection went beyond the typical customer-service provider dynamic. Randy and Nick would occasionally strike up conversations as they crossed paths, discussing anything from the latest headlines to the upcoming holidays in their neighborhood. These conversations served to deepen their established bond, as Randy began to see Nick as something of a mentor figure, and Nick found himself recalling his younger years through Randy's youthful spirit.\n"
"\n"
"As the months went by, Randy's dedication to delivering the newspaper to Nick remained as strong as ever. He even went the extra mile by ensuring the newspaper was always placed in the most convenient spot for Nick, such as tucking it under the doormat if it was windy or placing it in the mailbox to keep it dry on rainy days. Nick, in turn, showed his appreciation by occasionally leaving small tokens of gratitude, like coupons for a free ice cream cone or a crisp dollar bill, tucked in the mailbox for Randy to find when he delivered the paper.\n"
"\n"
"Every other day Randy delivered the newspaper to Nick who had a subscription, since it was not only a symbol of his dedication to serving his community but also a way of building meaningful connections with the people around him. Through his work, Randy learned valuable life lessons about responsibility, commitment, and the power of human connection, making him a valuable and respected member of their neighborhood. In many ways, their relationship was emblematic of a time when such simple, everyday interactions and exchanges helped to strengthen the bonds of a community."

"We were writing about the tomboy for the story instead of the plane because the plane was inanimate. While both the tomboy and the plane are interesting subjects, our focus in this particular story was to develop rich and multifaceted characters with personal struggles, aspirations, and growth. Since a tomboy is a human character, she can induce emotions and empathy in the audience, allowing for a more engaging story.\n"
"\n"
"Concentrating on a human character like the tomboy offers numerous benefits compared to highlighting an inanimate object like the plane. Firstly, human characters have emotions, thoughts, and different perspectives, enabling us to create a more diverse and intricate narrative. The tomboy's character arc can be shaped by her experiences and interactions with other characters in the story, providing opportunities for the complexities of human relationships to be explored. This would be difficult to accomplish if the central character were an inanimate object like the plane, as it lacks emotions and the ability to communicate through speech.\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, it is easier for readers to relate to and empathize with human characters. Audiences find it easier to become emotionally invested in a story when they can find aspects of their own lives mirrored in the characters. In the case of the tomboy, readers might identify with her struggles to find her identity, cope with societal expectations, or forge meaningful relationships with those around her. This emotional resonance might be lost if the plane were at the center of the story, as it would be more challenging to convey its significance to readers in a relatable manner.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, concentrating on the tomboy allows for a richer exploration of themes and messages. Human characters are capable of growth, change, and development over time, which encourages them to confront their flaws, learn from their mistakes, and persevere in the face of adversity. Such character arcs inspire readers and provoke thought about our own capacity for growth and transformation. But when we focus on an inanimate object like the plane, these themes of personal growth and resilience can become diluted or lost altogether.\n"
"\n"
"On the other hand, the plane could still play a vital role in the story. As a backdrop or plot device, the plane can contribute to the story's setting, create conflict for the characters, and shape the course of the narrative. For example, it could serve as a means of transportation for the tomboy on a life-changing journey, or as a potent symbol of her yearning for freedom and escape from societal pressures.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, we opted to write about the tomboy instead of the plane because the plane was inanimate. It was crucial for our story to have a character that could engage the reader emotionally through relatable experiences and personal growth. The tomboy offered the depth and complexity that our narrative demanded, while the plane remained a valuable supporting element in the story. Overall, we believed this choice would create a more captivating and thought-provoking story for our audience to enjoy."

"Question: A soccer ball takes twenty minutes to inflate. Alexia and Ermias are inflating balls, with Alexia inflating 20 balls and Ermias inflating 5 more balls than Alexia. Calculate the total time in minutes they took to inflate all the soccer balls.\n"
"Answer: To inflate a soccer ball, it takes 20 minutes, and if Alexia inflated 20 soccer balls, she took 20 * 20 = 400 minutes. Ermias has 5 more soccer balls than Alexia, meaning she has a total of 20 + 5 = 25 soccer balls. If each soccer ball takes 20 minutes to inflate, Ermias took 25 * 20 = 500 minutes to inflate all the soccer balls she had. Alexia and Ermias took 400 + 500 = 900 minutes to inflate all the soccer balls. The answer is 900.\n"

"[Answer]Since there are 20 fewer mittens pairs than the plugs, there are 150 + 20 = 170 pairs of plugs. When Gunner decides to add 30 more plugs pairs into the box of plugs, the number of plug pairs increases to 170 + 30 = 200. Since a pair has two, the 200 pairs of plugs total 200 * 2 = 400 plugs. The answer is 400.\n"
"Q: Mrs. Brynlee reduced the prices of items in her store by 20% after the local government gave small businesses in her county a subsidy. If the price of a shirt in the store was $60 and that of the leather jacket was $90, calculate the amount of money Teagan will pay for buying 5 shirts and 10 leather jackets at the reduced prices.\n"
"A: If the price of a shirt in the store was $60, its price was reduced by 20 / 100 * $60 = $12. The price of a shirt was reduced to $60 - $12 = $48. Teagan will pay $48 * 5 = $240 for buying 5 shirts. If the initial price of the leather jacket was $90, the price reduced by 20 / 100 * $90 = $18. The final leather jacket after Mrs. Brynlee reduced the price by 20% is $90 - $18 = $72. Teagan will pay $72 * 10 = $720 for buying 10 leather jackets. The amount of money Teagan paid to Mrs. Brynlee for the shirts and the leather jackets is $720 + $240 = $960. The answer is 960.\n"

"Yes, based on the paragraph provided, we can conclude that child labor is a challenge in India. The speaker, Anand, mentions the greatest and most urgent challenges of human rights in India, and lists several areas of concern, one of which is child labor. Let us examine this issue in detail to understand its implications and consequences on India and its population.\n"
"\n"
"Child labor refers to the employment of children below the legal working age, in jobs that can be physically, mentally, emotionally, or morally harmful. It is a significant problem in many countries, including India, where millions of children are involved in various forms of work. Child labor can have detrimental effects on the overall well-being, growth, and development of children, particularly concerning their health, education, and social integration.\n"
"\n"
"Addressing child labor as a human rights challenge suggests that it is not only an economic or social issue but also a moral and ethical one that concerns the dignity and the basic rights of children. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) have established international standards and regulations to prevent child labor and protect children's rights. India, as a signatory to both these global frameworks, has a responsibility to take measures to combat child labor and uphold the rights of its children.\n"
"\n"
"The issue of child labor in India is intertwined with other human rights challenges mentioned in the paragraph, like maternal and child care, child education, child abuse, and protection of minorities and weaker sections of society. Factors such as poverty, lack of access to quality education, social norms, and discrimination often contribute to the prevalence of child labor in the country. Children from marginalized communities, including minorities and weaker sections of society, are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse due to their socio-economic conditions.\n"
"\n"
"Addressing the challenge of child labor in India involves several strategies, including enforcing existing child labor laws more effectively, raising awareness among parents and communities about the adverse effects of child labor, providing access to quality education, and implementing social protection measures that support vulnerable families to secure sustainable livelihoods. It is essential for all stakeholders, including government agencies, non-government organizations, civil society, businesses, and individuals, to collaborate and take concerted efforts to eliminate child labor and ensure that the fundamental rights of children are respected and protected across India.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can indeed determine that child labor is a significant challenge in India concerning human rights. Addressing this issue requires a multi-faceted approach that encompasses legislative measures, educational reforms, social protection mechanisms, and cooperation among various stakeholders working together to promote and protect the rights of children in the country."

"The best answer to the question \"What is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols?\" is oxygen. \n"
"\n"
"To understand why oxygen is the essential component for cellular respiration in organisms consuming volatile organic acids (VOAs) and alcohols, it is important to first comprehend the role of oxygen in the process of cellular respiration and the characteristics of aerobic organisms.\n"
"\n"
"Cellular respiration is the process by which cells generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by breaking down organic molecules, such as glucose, fatty acids, or amino acids. There are two main types of cellular respiration: anaerobic respiration, which occurs without the presence of oxygen, and aerobic respiration, which requires oxygen to function. Aerobic respiration is a more efficient process than anaerobic respiration, as it produces more ATP per molecule of substrate.\n"
"\n"
"Aerobic organisms, which include the majority of plants, animals, fungi, and protists, are organisms that use oxygen to carry out cellular respiration. These organisms have evolved to depend on the presence of oxygen for energy production, as it enables them to efficiently break down organic molecules for energy.\n"
"\n"
"When aerobic organisms consume volatile organic acids (VOAs) and alcohols as energy sources, they still require oxygen to metabolize these substrates. VOAs, such as acetate and propionate, are converted into acetyl-CoA, which can then enter the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or the TCA cycle). Alcohols, such as ethanol, are first converted to acetaldehyde and then to acetate by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes, respectively, before entering the citric acid cycle as acetyl-CoA as well.\n"
"\n"
"The citric acid cycle, which is a central component of aerobic cellular respiration, relies on the presence of oxygen. When acetyl-CoA produced from VOAs and alcohols enters the citric acid cycle, high-energy electrons are transferred to carrier molecules, such as NAD+ and FAD, to form NADH and FADH2, respectively. These electron carriers subsequently donate their high-energy electrons to the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where the final electron acceptor is molecular oxygen (O2).\n"
"\n"
"Oxygen accepts these high-energy electrons, allowing the transport chain to pump protons (H+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient drives the enzyme ATP synthase to synthesize ATP. As a result, oxygen is essential for the completion of aerobic cellular respiration and the efficient generation of ATP.\n"
"\n"
"Based on the provided hints that \"oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for all aerobic organisms\" and \"aerobic organisms consume VOAs and alcohols,\" it can be concluded that oxygen is the best answer to the question. Oxygen is the key component required for cellular respiration when organisms consume VOAs and alcohols, as these substrates ultimately participate in the oxygen-dependent process of aerobic cellular respiration in order to generate energy in the form of ATP."

"When considering which of the following solutions is better for the goal of creating nylon products, it is important to assess the specific needs and demands of the intended application. Both solutions—comfortable underwear and fire-retardant suits—serve different purposes and cater to diverse functions. To thoroughly evaluate these options, let's analyze the advantages and disadvantages of both applications in the context of nylon usage.\n"
"\n"
"1. Comfortable Underwear:\n"
"\n"
"Advantages:\n"
"- Nylon is known for its lightweight, smooth, and soft texture, making it ideal for creating comfortable underwear that doesn't cause skin irritation.\n"
"- The fabric is known for its exceptional moisture-wicking capabilities, so nylon underwear can help keep the wearer dry and comfortable throughout the day.\n"
"- Due to its durability and resistance to abrasion, nylon underwear can retain its shape and last longer than underwear made from other types of fibers.\n"
"- The material is easy to care for, typically requiring only a cold machine wash and gentle tumble dry.\n"
"\n"
"Disadvantages:\n"
"- Nylon is not as breathable as natural fabrics like cotton, which can lead to potential discomfort for some users in warmer climates or for those who prefer more breathable materials.\n"
"- It is a synthetic fabric derived from petroleum, making it less eco-friendly compared to natural fibers.\n"
"\n"
"2. Fire-Retardant Suits:\n"
"\n"
"Advantages:\n"
"- Due to its heat-resistance properties, nylon can be treated with fire-retardant chemicals to make it suitable for protective clothing, such as fire-retardant suits.\n"
"- Fire-retardant nylon suits can provide adequate protection against heat, chemical exposure, and flame hazards in high-risk environments.\n"
"- The fabric's inherent strength and durability make it an excellent choice for workwear in extreme conditions, as it can withstand regular wear and tear despite constant exposure to harsh surroundings.\n"
"- When compared to other fire-retardant materials, nylon tends to be more comfortable and lightweight, which can be beneficial for workers required to wear such clothing for extended periods.\n"
"\n"
"Disadvantages:\n"
"- Despite its ability to be treated with fire-retardant chemicals, nylon can still melt when exposed to extremely high temperatures, which may not provide sufficient protection in certain applications.\n"
"- The production process of fire-retardant nylon can be more complicated and expensive than producing ordinary nylon.\n"
"- The chemicals used to treat fire-retardant clothing are not always eco-friendly or biodegradable, raising potential concerns for health and environmental impact.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, both options offer advantages and disadvantages and cater to entirely different needs. The choice between comfortable underwear and fire-retardant suits will largely depend on the target market, the specific requirements of the end-users, and the extent to which certain features are prioritized (comfort, breathability, heat resistance, etc.). Therefore, it is essential to consider these factors to determine which solution proves most beneficial concerning the intended goal of producing nylon products."

Later, his sister Piper comes home and takes 5 fewer bars than those taken in total by Thomas and his friends so she can also share with her friends. What's the total number of bars left in the box?\n"
"A: Thomas and his friends took 1 / 4 * 200 = 50 bars. The total number of bars left in the box was 200 - 50 = 150 bars. Since there are five of them sharing, each of them got 50 / 5 = 10 bars. After a friend returned 5 bars, there were 150 + 5 = 155 bars in the box. Piper took five fewer bars, that is 50 - 5 = 45 bars. The total remaining bars left in the box is 155 - 45 = 110 bars. The answer is 110.\n"
"Question: Donna made a cake to take to a party where the guests ate half the cake. The day after the party, she shared half the leftovers with her brothers. The following day, she ate one piece as a midnight snack. Twice as many pieces as her snack were left. How many pieces was the cake to begin with?\n"
"Answer: Donna had 2 * 1 = 2 pieces of cake left. Before her snack, there were 2 + 1 = 3 pieces left. Those 3 pieces were half the leftovers, so she had 3 * 2 = 6 pieces before sharing with her brothers. Those 6 pieces were half the party leftovers, so the cake was 2 * 6 = 12 pieces before the party. The answer is 12.\n"

"The Alaskan Husky and Small Münsterländer are two distinct breeds of dogs characterized by their unique traits, appearances, and historical backgrounds. Both breeds serve specific purposes and are highly valued by their owners for their respective qualities.\n"
"\n"
"The Alaskan Husky, as the name suggests, originates from Alaska and is primarily a sled dog breed. Alaskan Huskies are renowned for their incredible stamina, speed, and endurance in harsh winter climates. They have been selectively bred over many generations, focusing on their work performance rather than conforming to a specific breed standard. Consequently, their physical features can vary significantly, but they generally have a lean and muscular build. Alaskan Huskies have a medium to a large body size, standing around 20 to 24 inches at the shoulder and weighing around 35 to 60 pounds.\n"
"\n"
"Alaskan Huskies have a double coat of fur that insulates them from the cold – the outer coat being dense and relatively short, while the undercoat is soft and warm. Their eye colors can range from blue to brown, and in some cases, they even have heterochromatic eyes, where each eye is a different color. It's important to note that Alaskan Huskies are not officially recognized as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC) or any other major kennel clubs due to their variable appearances and the emphasis on performance over appearance.\n"
"\n"
"On the other hand, the Small Münsterländer, also known as the Kleiner Münsterländer Vorstehhund, hails from the Münster region in Germany. This breed is a versatile hunting dog, adept at pointing, retrieving, and tracking game. Small Münsterländers are part of the Continental pointing dog group and have a long history that dates back to as early as the 16th century. They possess strong hunting instincts and are highly valued for their adaptability to various terrains, including swamps, forests, and fields.\n"
"\n"
"Small Münsterländers are medium-sized dogs, standing at around 19 to 21 inches at the shoulder and weighing between 40 to 60 pounds. They have a sleek and muscular build, with a characteristic feathering on their ears, legs, and tails. The breed has a dense, wavy medium-length coat that is primarily white with patches of solid brown or brown roan. Small Münsterländers have expressive brown eyes that reflect their intelligence and attentive nature.\n"
"\n"
"In contrast to the Alaskan Husky, the Small Münsterländer is recognized as a breed by major kennel clubs, including the AKC. Their versatile hunting abilities, coupled with their loyal, friendly, and intelligent personalities, also make them affectionate companions and family pets.\n"
"\n"
"In summary, the Alaskan Husky is a highly efficient sled dog originating from Alaska, known for its stamina and adaptability to cold climates. On the other hand, the Small Münsterländer is a versatile and skilled German hunting dog with a storied history and an officially recognized breed standard. While both breeds share some similarities in their intelligence and work ethic, they differ significantly in their appearances, breed recognition, and primary functions."

"\n"
"Supergirl is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by writer Otto Binder and designed by artist Al Plastino. Supergirl first appeared in a story published in Action Comics #252 (May 1959) titled \"The Supergirl from Krypton\". Kara Zor-El is the biological cousin of Kal-El (Superman).\n"
"\n"
"After long-time Superman family editor Mort Weisinger retired in 1971, the character underwent revitalization under editor Joe Orlando and artist Mike Sekowsky. Wearing a series of new outfits, leaving her adopted foster home with the Danvers family, Linda goes on to San Francisco where she works for KSF-TV as a camera operator and develops a crush on her boss, Geoffrey Anderson. These stories introduced Supergirl's most memorable villain from this period: Lex Luthor's niece Nasthalthia, or Nasty. Nasty had made two appearances towards the end of Linda's college years, then pursued her to KSF-TV, trying to secure proof of her dual identity.  Supergirl starred in her first solo eponymous monthly series beginning in 1972 until October 1974, when her monthly title merged with Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane, and Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen to produce a new title: then-highest DC selling series called The Superman Family, where she eventually became the steady lead story. Linda worked as a student advisor at New Athens Experimental School, before leaving for New York to follow a career in acting with daytime soap Secret Hearts.  In 1982 Supergirl received a second monthly solo series titled The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl, relocating the character to Chicago as Linda became a mature student of Psychology. Industry legend, and former DC Publisher, Carmine Infantino provided the pencilled art (Bob Oksner inked). With issue 13 the title was revamped, with a new costume design (sporting a red headband) and the title shortened to just Supergirl. The series ran until sudden cancellation in 1984, only two months before the character's debut in a big-budget Hollywood film starring Helen Slater.  In the Crisis on Infinite Earths (1985) the greatest heroes from Earth-One, Earth-Two, Earth-Four, Earth-S, and Earth-X join forces in order to defeat the Anti-Monitor. When Superman comes face to face with the Anti-Monitor and is knocked unconscious, Supergirl rushes to save him before he is killed. She is able to fight him off long enough for Dr. Light to carry her cousin to a safe distance, but is killed by the Anti-Monitor. A public memorial service for Supergirl takes place in Chicago, where Batgirl (Barbara Gordon) delivers the eulogy. In her remarks she states \"Kara is a hero. She will not be forgotten.\" Superman then gives his late cousin burial by taking her corpse to Rokyn/New Krypton to Zor-El and Allura. A Superman issue the next month reveals that Kara had experienced a premonition about her own passing. However, when the universe is rebooted, the timeline is altered. Kara Zor-El and all memory of her is erased from existence.\n"

"23-year-old John Ward changed the lives of many on an ordinary day in Birmingham City Centre back in January. The city witnessed a horrific event that shall remain etched in the minds of its residents for a long time. On that fateful day, Wayne Busst, aged 32, and Ian Watson-Gladwish, aged 31, fell victims to a horrendous attack perpetrated by John Ward, which ultimately led to their untimely demise.\n"
"\n"
"Available CCTV footage starkly displays the chilling sequence of events leading up to the double manslaughter. In the tapes, Ward can be observed making purchases of a knife and alcohol, engaging animatedly in a conversation with the soon-to-be victims on the street, just hours before launching his frenzied, deadly assault. \n"
"\n"
"John Ward, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, had reportedly disclosed to his doctors at Ashworth Hospital, a high-security medical facility, that he kept hearing disturbing voices in his head encouraging him to commit acts of fatal violence. The voices were relentless, he revealed, in pushing his fragile mind to 'kill everyone.' The terrifying power of these hallucinations grew to an extent that his control over his own actions began to slip away.\n"
"\n"
"The fatal incident unfolded smack in the middle of rush hour. Despite the bustle and urgency around them, nothing could deter the horrific episode from taking place. In front of stunned commuters, Ward launched a brutal assault on Busst and Watson-Gladwish, brandishing the knife that he had purchased only a couple of hours earlier. The city centre, typically abuzz with the noise of traffic, work, and life, caught its breath in shock and horror as the gruesome drama played out on the streets.\n"
"\n"
"The aftermath brought Ward before the Birmingham Crown Court, the haunting memories of his paranoid schizophrenia testifying alongside him. At the trial, Ward communicated his plea via video link. He admitted his guilt but pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. This unusual plea posits that although he had confessed to the crime, he argued that his mental disorder had significantly impaired his abilities to control or understand his actions.\n"
"\n"
"Recognizing Ward's mental health status and his plea's legal validity, the court sentenced him to life imprisonment. Though Ward must bear the punishment for his actions, the trial also exposed some severe complexities entwinded with mental illness and criminal responsibility. \n"
"\n"
"Despite the tragic loss of life, society is prodded to ponder on pressing questions about mental health care. How many individuals like Ward are struggling unnoticed and unaided? When does the line between victim and villain begin to blur? \n"
"\n"
"John Ward’s case underscores the critical importance of robust mental health care infrastructure, early diagnosis, and timely intervention. Indeed, this incident, although deeply tragic, spotlights the dire need for addressing mental health issues publicly and proactively to prevent such horrifying incidents in the future."

"Title: Major Changes in Timeline of Las Vegas Shooting Unveiled by Clark County Sheriff\n"
"\n"
"Introduction\n"
"\n"
"On October 1, 2017, America was shaken by the deadliest mass shooting in its modern history. The assailant, Stephen Paddock, opened fire at a crowd in the Route 91 Harvest music festival near the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Resort in Las Vegas, leaving at least 58 dead and hundreds injured. As the investigation continues, new information surfaces, altering our understanding of the event. This article will delve into the major changes in the timeline of the Las Vegas shooting incident, based on the statements of the Clark County Sheriff, Joe Lombardo.\n"
"\n"
"The chronological change and its implications\n"
"\n"
"The most significant change in the course of events involves the hotel security guard, Jesus Campos, injured by Paddock. Previously, it was believed that Paddock ceased fire on the festival crowd following Campos' arrival on the assailant's floor. However, Sheriff Joe Lombardo now says Campos was shot before Paddock began firing at the festival crowd.\n"
"\n"
"According to Lombardo, Campos was investigating a report of an open door on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel when he heard drilling sounds coming from Paddock's room. Upon realizing that Campos was approaching, Paddock opened fire into the hallway, hitting Campos in the leg. Despite being injured, Campos alerted security officials to the shooter's location. The sheriff added that Paddock started firing on the crowd about six minutes after shooting Campos. Paddock never completed his drilling, which may have been meant to install additional cameras or provide access for more gunfire.\n"
"\n"
"This change in the timeline raises new questions about law enforcement's response to the incident and the subsequent investigation. The sheriff did not provide an explanation for why this alteration was made to the timeline and did not comment on its effects on the ongoing investigation, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Sheriff Lombardo said, \"In your zest for information and my zest to ensure the public safety and the calming of their minds, some things are going to change.\"\n"
"\n"
"Paddock's surveillance efforts and motive\n"
"\n"
"Sheriff Lombardo disclosed that Paddock had installed hidden cameras in the hotel room, suggesting he carefully planned and prepared for the attack. These cameras may have helped Paddock watch for approaching security threats, such as Campos. As of now, law enforcement officials have not been able to identify Paddock's motive for the shooting.\n"
"\n"
"Conclusion\n"
"\n"
"As the investigation into the Las Vegas shooting continues, new revelations like the ones from Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo will alter our perception of the horrific event. With many questions still unanswered, including the motive and law enforcement's response, the public eagerly awaits further information to piece together the complete picture of the fateful night. It is important to remember, however, that the investigation process may be fluid and susceptible to changes in an attempt to establish a thorough understanding of the events that transpired."

"Please answer the following question: Information:  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city.  - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity.  - The Sioux are groups of Native American tribes and First Nations peoples in North America. The term can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation's many language dialects. The Sioux comprise three major divisions based on language divisions: the Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota.  - The Territory of Dakota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 2, 1861, until November 2, 1889, when the final extent of the reduced territory was split and admitted to the Union as the states of North and South Dakota.  - The South Dakota Department of Transportation is a state government organization in charge of maintaining public roadways of the U.S. state of South Dakota . South Dakota has 82,447 miles of highways , roads and streets ; 5,905 bridges . The SD DOT is responsible for 7,830 miles of the roadway system .

"The electron transport chain (ETC) is a critical process in cellular respiration, playing a fundamental role in converting energy from nutrient molecules into the readily usable form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Electrons play an essential role in this process, and their origin in the electron transport chain comes primarily from the reduction of certain coenzymes during the earlier stages of cellular respiration.\n"
"\n"
"In eukaryotic cells, the electron transport chain is located within the inner mitochondrial membrane, while in prokaryotic cells, it's embedded in the plasma membrane. The process allows for the controlled release of energy, which is harnessed for ATP synthesis. The ETC consists of a series of protein complexes (Complexes I-IV) and mobile electron carriers.\n"
"\n"
"The source of electrons in the electron transport chain can be traced back to the earlier stages of cellular respiration, including glycolysis, the conversion of pyruvate to Acetyl CoA, and the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or the TCA cycle).\n"
"\n"
"During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate, generating a small amount of ATP. During this stage, a pair of electrons are transferred to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), reducing it to NADH. This transfer occurs by the removal of a hydrogen atom, consisting of a proton and an electron, from a molecule in the glycolytic pathway. The NADH thus produced carries high-energy electrons and moves to the next stages of cellular respiration.\n"
"\n"
"The pyruvate molecules generated in glycolysis are transported into the mitochondria (in eukaryotes) and converted into Acetyl CoA. In this process, another pair of electrons are transferred from pyruvate to NAD+, generating another molecule of NADH. This takes place through the action of an enzyme known as pyruvate dehydrogenase.\n"
"\n"
"Next comes the citric acid cycle, where each Acetyl CoA enters the cycle and undergoes a series of chemical reactions. Throughout this process, electrons are further extracted and transferred to both NAD+ and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The reduction of these coenzymes results in the formation of NADH and FADH2. For each turn of the citric acid cycle, three molecules of NADH and one molecule of FADH2 are produced.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, the electrons carried by NADH and FADH2 enter the electron transport chain. Complex I and Complex II in the ETC receive electrons from NADH and FADH2, respectively. These complexes pass the electrons through a series of redox reactions to additional protein complexes and mobile electron carriers. The ultimate destination of these electrons is molecular oxygen (O2), which becomes reduced to form water.\n"
"\n"
"In summary, the electrons involved in the electron transport chain come primarily from the reduction of NAD+ and FAD during glycolysis, pyruvate conversion to Acetyl CoA, and the citric acid cycle. As these high-energy electrons pass through the ETC, they release energy that is used to create an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which in turn enables the synthesis of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation."

"Background: Louis Leo Holtz (born January 6, 1937) is a former American football player, coach, and analyst. He served as the head football coach at The College of William & Mary (1969-1971), North Carolina State University (1972-1975), the New York Jets (1976), the University of Arkansas (1977-1983), the University of Minnesota (1984-1985), the University of Notre Dame (1986-1996), and the University of South Carolina (1999-2004), compiling a career record of 249-132-7. Holtz's 1988 Notre Dame team went 12-0 with a victory in the Fiesta Bowl and was the consensus national champion. Holtz is the only college football coach to lead six different programs to bowl games and the only coach to guide four different programs to the final top 20 rankings.\n"
"Context: After two seasons as a commentator for CBS Sports, Holtz came out of retirement in 1999 and returned to the University of South Carolina, where he had been an assistant in the 1960s. The year before Holtz arrived, the Gamecocks went 1-10, and the team subsequently went 0-11 during Holtz's first season. In his second season, South Carolina went 8-4, winning the Outback Bowl over the heavily favored Ohio State Buckeyes. The eight-game improvement from the previous year was the best in the nation in 2000 and the third best single-season turnaround in NCAA history. It also earned National Coach of the Year honors for Holtz from Football News and American Football Coaches Quarterly. In his third season, Holtz's success continued, leading the Gamecocks to a 9-3 record and another Outback Bowl victory over Ohio State. The nine wins for the season were the second highest total in the history of the program. Under Holtz's leadership, the Gamecocks posted their best two-year mark in school history from 2000 to 2001, going 17-7 overall and 10-6 in SEC play.  After consecutive 5-7 campaigns in 2002 and 2003, Holtz finished his South Carolina tenure on a winning note with a 6-5 record in 2004. Holtz's time in Columbia saw the resurrection of Gamecock Football, as the program had only one bowl win and no Top 25 finishes in the ten years before his hire. Upon his exit, USC had posted AP Top 25 finishes in 2000 and 2001 (#19 and No. 13 respectively) and had made consecutive New Year's Day bowls for the first time in its history. Holtz finished his six-year tenure at South Carolina with a 2-4 record versus his former team, Arkansas, beating the Razorbacks in Columbia, SC in 2000 and 2004.  In 2005, the NCAA imposed three years probation and reductions in two scholarships on the program for ten admitted violations under Holtz, five of which were found to be major. The violations involved improper tutoring and off-season workouts, as well as a lack of institutional control. No games were forfeited, and no television or postseason ban was imposed. Holtz issued a statement after the sanctions were announced stating, \"There was no money involved. No athletes were paid. There were no recruiting inducements. No cars. No jobs offered. No ticket scandal.\"\n"

"Title: Kristen Stewart Overcomes Personal Struggles and Lands Lead Role in \"Lie Down in Darkness\"\n"
"\n"
"In the midst of personal strife, it seems Kristen Stewart can still count on her incredible acting skills to carry her through, as Vulture reports that the Twilight star has secured the lead role in the upcoming film adaptation of William Styron's 1951 novel, Lie Down In Darkness. This news may come as a disappointment for Hunger Games actress Jennifer Lawrence, who had also hoped to snag the coveted part. \n"
"\n"
"Stewart will bring the character of Peyton Loftis to life on the big screen, under the direction of Scott Cooper. Cooper is known for his work on Crazy Heart, which further highlights the prestigious nature of Stewart's recent achievement. This casting goes on to prove that despite setbacks in her personal life, Kristen Stewart continues to push forward in advancing her career. \n"
"\n"
"However, the future of another anticipated sequel remains uncertain. As fans eagerly await news on the Snow White and the Huntsman sequel, no concrete information about its production has been shared. The main concern rests on whether Kristen's cheating partner, director Rupert Sanders, will be part of the project. Radar reports that Sander's wife, Liberty Ross, has put her foot down and is refusing to let her husband work with his former mistress again.\n"
"\n"
"Adding further turmoil to an already tumultuous situation, Kristen Stewart has allegedly been banned from the premiere of Robert Pattinson's new film, Cosmopolis. According to a source, \"Robert just doesn’t want to see her.\" This could very well signify that there's still lingering tension between the two stars following their high-profile breakup.\n"
"\n"
"While there is no doubt that Kristen Stewart's personal life has seen better days, her professional achievements should not be overshadowed as a result. The actress has worked hard to hone her craft, and landing the lead role in Lie Down In Darkness is a testament to her unwavering commitment and skill. As fans and the entertainment world continue to focus on romantic entanglements and hurt feelings, Kristen Stewart remains steadfast in proving her worth as a talented actress. \n"
"\n"
"It remains to be seen what the Snow White and the Huntsman sequel holds for Stewart's future career trajectory, but in the meantime, her acting chops have secured a prominent job in the highly anticipated film adaptation of a classic American novel. As for now, it's crucial for Stewart to maintain her focus on her professional endeavors and hope that her personal life will eventually find stability.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, Kristen Stewart's personal struggles have undoubtedly played out publicly, throwing her under relentless scrutiny and judgment. However, by landing the lead role in Lie Down In Darkness, she displays fortitude and perseverance in an industry that can be both cruel and forgiving. Regardless of further developments in her personal life, Kristen Stewart is an actress with undeniable talent and a continued drive to succeed in her career, which is something both her fans and critics should respect and admire."

"Article:The Scottish government is considering protecting 32,000 square miles of seas, an area roughly as big as the country.\n"
"The network is designed to safeguard the future of rich and diverse coastal habitats and maintain a healthy marine ecosystem.\n"
"Some opposition has been put forward by fishermen, and the scheme could also impact on offshore renewable energy.\n"
"The Marine (Scotland) Act 2010 included new powers to select and manage Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).\n"
"In a report to the Scottish Parliament, Scottish Natural Heritage and UK-wide advisory body the Joint Nature Conservation Committee have put forward 33 MPA proposals.\n"
"A further four areas have been identified to protect dolphins, whales and basking sharks, along with proposals for black guillemot, sandeels and tidal fronts to enhance protection for seabirds.\n"
"Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said:  \"Accounting for 13% of Europe's seas and 61% of UK waters, Scotland's seas include many diverse habitats, with rare and beautiful species that it is our responsibility to protect.\n"
"\"That's why the Marine Act included ambitious commitments to safeguards our seas.\n"
"\"Not only that but a healthy marine ecosystem underpins the nursery grounds for the species our fishermen rely on, the reefs and kelp forests that protect our coasts by buffering against storms - as well as the clean waters needed to absorb carbon dioxide and help in the fight against climate change.\"\n"
"Scottish Natural Heritage called the report an important milestone.\n"
"Chief executive Ian Jardine said: \"Scotland's seas are a fantastic asset that contributes enormously to our quality of life and our economy. Managing them in a sustainable way is a complex task.\"\n"
"RSPB Scotland said the proposals were a step in the right direction, but represented a \"massive missed opportunity\".\n"
"Director Stuart Housden said: \"Despite Scotland being globally important for these species, seabirds have been almost completely marginalised in the identification of Scotland's new Marine Protected Areas.\n"
"\"These proposals offer precious little protection for Scotland's seabirds - iconic species like the puffin, razorbill and kittiwake.\n"
"\"The government claims seabirds will be adequately protected by Special Protection Areas designated under European legislation.  Let there be no confusion - these promised SPAs are essential, but they cannot and will not protect nationally important concentrations of seabirds feeding at sea.\"\n"
"Fishermen in the Western Isles have campaigned against the creation of a Special Area of Conservation in the Sound of Barra.\n"
"The new Marine Protected Areas could also have an impact on the positioning and design of offshore renewables.\n"
"Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said they would study the proposals.\n"
"He added: \"It is absolutely essential that science guides the process, which must serve the requirements of the marine environment and of sustainable harvesting of seafood.\n"
"\"If MPAs in Scottish waters are properly organised, the objectives should actively support each other.\"\n"

"Whitney Elizabeth Houston (August 9, 1963 - February 11, 2012) was an American singer, actress, producer, and model. In 2009, Guinness World Records cited her as the most awarded female act of all time. Houston is one of the best-selling music artists of all-time, with 200 million records sold worldwide. She released seven studio albums and two soundtrack albums, all of which have diamond, multi-platinum, platinum, or gold certification.\n"
"\n"
"Houston reportedly appeared \"disheveled\" and \"erratic\" in the days immediately prior to her death. On Thursday, February 9, 2012, Houston visited singers Brandy and Monica, together with Clive Davis, at their rehearsals for Davis' pre-Grammy Awards party at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills. That same day, she made her last public performance when she joined Kelly Price on stage in Hollywood, California and sang \"Jesus Loves Me\".  Two days later, on February 11, Houston was found unconscious in Suite 434 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, submerged in the bathtub. Beverly Hills paramedics arrived at approximately 3:30 p.m., found the singer unresponsive, and performed CPR. Houston was pronounced dead at 3:55 p.m. PST. The cause of death was not immediately known; local police said there were \"no obvious signs of criminal intent\". On March 22, 2012, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office reported that Houston's death was caused by drowning and the \"effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use\". The office stated the amount of cocaine found in Houston's body indicated that she used the substance shortly before her death. Toxicology results revealed additional drugs in her system: diphenhydramine (Benadryl), alprazolam (Xanax), cannabis and cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril). The manner of death was listed as an \"accident\".  An invitation-only memorial service was held for Houston on Saturday, February 18, 2012, at the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey. The service was scheduled for two hours, but lasted four. Among those who performed at the funeral were Stevie Wonder (rewritten version of \"Ribbon in the Sky\", and \"Love's in Need of Love Today\"), CeCe Winans (\"Don't Cry\", and \"Jesus Loves Me\"), Alicia Keys (\"Send Me an Angel\"), Kim Burrell (rewritten version of \"A Change Is Gonna Come\"), and R. Kelly (\"I Look to You\"). The performances were interspersed with hymns by the church choir and remarks by Clive Davis, Houston's record producer; Kevin Costner; Rickey Minor, her music director; her cousin, Dionne Warwick; and Ray Watson, her security guard for the past 11 years. Aretha Franklin was listed on the program and was expected to sing, but was unable to attend the service. Bobby Brown, Houston's ex-husband, was also invited to the funeral but he left shortly after the service began. Houston was buried on February 19, 2012, in Fairview Cemetery, in Westfield, New Jersey, next to her father, John Russell Houston, who died in 2003. In June 2012, the McDonald's Gospelfest in Newark became a tribute to Houston.\n"

"Title: The Denver Post Seeks Journalist to Cover Marijuana Scene, But There's a Catch…\n"
"\n"
"The Denver Post is on the lookout for a talented and enthusiastic journalist to join their team and cover the ever-growing marijuana scene in the United States and Canada. With recent legalization battles taking place across North America, this is a story that continues to develop and unfold, making it a critical beat for many news organizations. However, before you start imagining a laid-back lifestyle and puffing away at work, there's a catch: The successful candidate must pass a drug test.\n"
"\n"
"This opportunity to become a marijuana journalist - or cannabis correspondent, as some are calling it - has many intrigued, including Washington Post reporter Christopher Ingraham, who tweeted about the position saying, \"DREAM JOB SIREN.\" The chosen journalist will cover stories for the Denver Post's dedicated marijuana news website, the Cannabist.\n"
"\n"
"The Cannabist, launched in 2013, has become a prominent source of news, culture, and information about marijuana. As the legal cannabis industry expands across the United States and Canada, the demand for well-rounded coverage of the rapidly changing landscape also grows. This is where the talented new hire will need to step in, taking on the responsibility of reporting on the ongoing legalization battles and any other cannabis-related topics that may arise.\n"
"\n"
"However, don't be too quick to assume this job posting is a stoner's dream. The advertisement for the position takes a firm stance on drug testing, stating, \"As with every Denver Post position, a qualified candidate must successfully pass a drug test.\" This requirement means that even though the journalist will be covering stories about cannabis, they cannot partake in the very subject they report on.\n"
"\n"
"So, who is the ideal candidate for this unique position? The Denver Post is looking for a data journalist who has experience creating maps, charts, and graphs. Such skills will be crucial for presenting information about the marijuana industry, legislation, and consumer trends in a clear, engaging, and visual manner.\n"
"\n"
"The person selected for this role will be diving into the complexities of the legal cannabis industry, exploring how it is evolving and the impact of related policies, economic shifts, and social changes. They will be at the forefront of reporting on matters that are shaping public opinion, influencing business decisions, and affecting everyday lives. In short, this is an opportunity to become a part of history as it unfolds, contributing to a greater understanding of the marijuana landscape both nationally and internationally.\n"
"\n"
"Despite the drug test requirement, this position offers a unique opportunity for a skilled and passionate journalist to cover a rapidly evolving industry and become a significant voice in the ongoing narrative surrounding cannabis. For the right candidate, it could indeed be the \"DREAM JOB\" that many could only hope for. But for those stoners who just cannot resist indulging in the subject matter, it might be worth considering a different career path."

It usually takes Matthew 1 hour to assemble ingredients, 1.5 hours to bake the cakes, and another 1 hour to decorate each cake with cinnamon sprinkles. One day, Matthew's oven failed to reach the correct temperature and it took twice as long for the cakes to bake as they usually take. On that day, how long did it take, in hours, for Matthew to make his famous caramel-apple coffee cakes?\n"
"A: Twice 1.5 hours is 2 * 1.5 = 3 hours. Thus, on that day, it took Matthew 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 hours to make the cakes. The answer is 5.\n"
"Question: Emily wants to know how much it rained last week. She sees that it rained 2 inches on Monday morning and 1 more inch later that day. It rained twice that much on Tuesday. It did not rain on Wednesday but on Thursday it rained 1 inch. The biggest storm was on Friday when the total was equal to Monday through Thursday combined. What was the daily average rain total for the week?\n"
"Answer: The total rain was 2 inches + 1 inches = 3 inches on Monday. The total rain was 2 * 3 inches = 6 inches on Tuesday. The total rain was 0 inches + 1 inch = 1 inch across Wednesday and Thursday. The total rain was 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch = 10 inches on Friday. There were 3 inches + 6 inches + 1 inch + 10 inches = 20 inches total last week. 20 inches / 5 days = 4 inches average daily rain. The answer is 4.\n"

"Craig had always been a little more self-conscious about his appearance than Eric. He believed that having smooth, hairless legs could make him feel more confident in his athletic pursuits and overall life. Eric, on the other hand, never really paid much attention to his appearance or the grooming habits of others.\n"
"\n"
"Craig's decision to shave his legs was influenced by several factors. First and foremost, he looked up to professional athletes, particularly swimmers and cyclists, who shaved their legs to achieve a more aerodynamic edge during competitions. Craig admired their dedication to their sport and the minutiae of their routine, something that Eric didn't seem to understand or appreciate.\n"
"\n"
"Another reason behind Craig's decision was the social aspect of it. He noticed that many of his friends and acquaintances, both male and female, preferred the look of smooth, hairless legs. They commented on how it made them feel clean and more attractive. This, in turn, made Craig more aware of his own body hair and prompted him to give shaving his legs a try.\n"
"\n"
"However, this decision was not without challenges for Craig. He had to learn the proper technique for achieving a close shave without irritating his skin or causing cuts and nicks. He also dealt with the occasional ridicule from people like Eric, who found leg-shaving to be an odd or unnecessary habit, particularly for men.\n"
"\n"
"In spite of the criticism, Craig was unwavering in his decision. He felt that dedicating time and effort to maintaining his appearance was just another form of self-care, much like exercising or eating a balanced diet. It became a ritual for him to meticulously shave his legs, taking as much time as needed to achieve the desired results. This act served as a reminder of the discipline and commitment he aimed to apply in other aspects of his life.\n"
"\n"
"Eric, on the other hand, had a more laid-back approach to personal grooming. He saw no need to remove any body hair, as it didn't bother him physically or aesthetically. In a sense, Eric prided himself on embracing his natural look, with a tinge of defiance toward societal beauty standards.\n"
"\n"
"This difference in their grooming habits often led to subtle tension between Craig and Eric. While they were still good friends, they couldn't help but secretly judge one another's choices. Craig perceived Eric's disregard for shaving his legs as laziness or a lack of self-care, whereas Eric viewed Craig's shaving routine as vanity and excessive concern with appearance.\n"
"\n"
"In the end, despite their disagreement on this particular aspect of self-care, both Craig and Eric maintained a strong friendship. They learned to accept their differences as simply a matter of personal preference and enjoyed some friendly banter about the subject every now and then.\n"
"\n"
"It's vital to respect each person's choice regarding the care and presentation of their own body and understand that everyone's preferences and priorities are unique. As long as the choice stems from a place of self-love or self-expression, it's all a part of one's personal journey toward contentment and empowerment."

"Judas Priest are an English heavy metal band formed in West Bromwich in 1969. The band have sold over 50 million copies of their albums to date. They are frequently ranked as one of the greatest metal bands of all time. Despite an innovative and pioneering body of work in the latter half of the 1970s, the band struggled with indifferent record production, repeated changes of drummer, and lack of major commercial success or attention until 1980, when they adopted a more simplified sound on the album British Steel, which helped shoot them to rock superstar status.\n"
"\n"
"Judas Priest were formed in 1969 in industrial West Bromwich, in the Black Country, by vocalist Al Atkins and bassist Brian \"Bruno\" Stapenhill, with John Perry on guitar and John \"Fezza\" Partridge on drums. Perry soon died in a road accident, and amongst the replacements the band auditioned were future Judas Priest guitarist Kenny \"K. K.\" Downing; at the time, they turned him down in favour of 17-year-old multi-instrumentalist Ernest Chataway, who had played with Birmingham band Black Sabbath when they were still called Earth. Stapenhill came up with the name Judas Priest from Bob Dylan's song \"The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\" on the album John Wesley Harding. No member of that early lineup lasted long enough to play on the band's recordings, though several songs co-written by Atkins appeared on their first two albums.  The band gained a three-album recording contract with the label Immediate in late 1969 after a gig in Walsall, but the label went out of business before an album could be recorded, and the band split in 1970. Late in the year, Atkins found a heavy rock band rehearsing without a singer called Freight, made up of K. K. Downing on guitar, his childhood friend Ian \"Skull\" Hill on bass, and drummer John Ellis. He joined them, and they took on Atkins' defunct band's name. Their first gig was on 6 March 1971. Ellis quit later that year and was replaced with Alan Moore. Early shows included Hendrix and Quatermass covers, and in 1972 the set list included the originals \"Never Satisfied\", \"Winter\", and the show-closer \"Caviar and Meths\".  Moore left and was replaced with Christopher Louis \"Congo\" Campbell, and the band joined Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi's management agency Iommi Management Agency. Atkins continued to write material for the band--including \"Whiskey Woman\", which became the base for the Judas Priest staple \"Victim of Changes\"--but as finances were tight and he had a family to support, he played his last gigs with the band in December 1972. Campbell left soon afterwards, and the band enlisted two members of the band Hiroshima: drummer John Hinch and vocalist Rob Halford, the brother of Hill's girlfriend. Judas Priest made their first tour of continental Europe in early 1974 and returned to England that April to sign a recording deal with the label Gull. Gull suggested adding a fifth member to fill out the band's sound; they took on as a second lead guitarist Glenn Tipton, whose group The Flying Hat Band were also managed by Iommi's agency.\n"

"Homeland - box set review\n"
"Homeland is 24 for grownups. The hit US spy drama, which has just completed its third season with the first two now out on box set, hits the gold standard of gripping plotting and complex characterisation. The terrorist threat level is on permanent red alert and the CIA is so suffused with terror-paranoia that it subjects a US war hero and its own agents alike to surveillance, harassment and even polygraph tests. \"When was the last time you told the truth?\" asks Carrie Mathison, played by Claire Danes. It's a line that haunts every episode.\n"
"\n"
"Season one, aired in 2011, hinges on the question: has Gulf war hero Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), held in an Afghan hole for eight years, been \"turned\" by al-Qaida? Lewis won an Emmy for his portrayal of the traumatised marine; Danes won two for her role – hunter to Brody's hunted. As a bipolar intelligence agent Carrie joins a clutch of intense, idiosyncratic female leads in current TV drama (Spiral, The Killing, The Bridge, The Fall). Her judgments are brilliantly unhinged: her CIA mentor, Saul Berenson, calls her \"the smartest and the dumbest fucking person I've ever known\".\n"
"\n"
"Thus Carrie's strategies for outing Brody include wiring his house for sound and vision, like a terrorist Big Brother. This includes the bedroom: surveillance sex-scenes are a regularly disconcerting Homeland trope. Carrie's next choice is to have sex with Brody herself. A truth or dare, double-bluff love affair ensues: will they kiss or kill each other next? When Carrie's question for Brody's polygraph test – \"Have you ever been unfaithful to your wife?\" – elicits Brody's unblinking \"no\", the paranoia ratchets up again: what else is Brody lying about? Danes' eyes get wider by the episode: Lewis's mouth gets tighter. By the end of season one Carrie's off her meds, off her head – and off the CIA payroll.\n"
"\n"
"By contrast, Mandy Patinkin as old agency hand Saul is a study in stillness. Despite another life as a musicals diva, Patinkin is the calm in the eye of the show's hurricane, a microcosm of how Homeland's characterisation anchors its less likely plot lurches. Season two sees computer hacks on a vice-president's pacemaker, al-Qaida kingpins lurking alone in dark tunnels like sci-fi aliens, and CIA bosses blithely listening to their agents having sex with terrorist suspects.\n"
"\n"
"Although less credible and, with Carrie on lithium, more conventional, season two is still a mesmerising affair. We watch Brody achieving political office as cohort of a hawkish vice-president (Homeland's neocons arguably come off almost as badly as Muslims). But is Congressman Brody, as Carrie accuses, a \"terrorist and a traitor\"? It's hardly a conventional terrorist suspect interrogation that begins: \"You broke my heart, you know?\" and ends with an invitation to cohabit.\n"
"\n"
"As Carrie and Saul battle to avert a planned attack on the US, knowledge turns out be illusory, victories pyrrhic, while the nature of terror-boss Abu Nazir's plot remains a mystery until the season's closing minutes. And the finish is literally explosive.\n"

"Review: The narrative affirms the classic image of good versus evil in the form of a struggle of brother against brother. The main character, Lin Macadam, played by James Stewart, represents justice and righteousness. His brother, who operates under the persona of Dutch Henry Brown, played by Stephen McNally, stands for the classic stage-coach robbing western outlaw, chased by his brother for having killed their father. The world the story takes place is the classic dystopian west where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their sidearms as soon as they enter town, and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic western lawman Wyat Earp. \n"
"\n"
"Present as well are such flat characters typical of the western, such as the murderous Indian warrior, the besieged cavalryman, and the bonnet-clad damsel in distress. \n"
"\n"
"Another important archetype in this film, that which gives the film it's name, is a custom made Winchester rifle. The weapon can be viewed as an allegory for the rewards given to those who do things honorably. Once it is stolen from its rightful owner, it brings tragedy to everyone that comes in contact with it. In this sense it resembles other such icons like the holy grail in Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the blood stained letter in Saving Private Ryan. This gives the film an element of surrealism which is usually absent from westerns, a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols. \n"
"\n"
"Being essentially a revenge film, it shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as Jack Arnold's No Name on the Bullet, and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. \n"
"\n"
"There is also a tacit theme of rape in Winchester '73. Waco Johnny Dean, one of the film's villains played very effectively by Dan Duryea, abducts a woman after killing her husband. The volatile cowboy toys with the tenderfoot husband, and dispatches him like a caricature of a cat toying with an insect before biting its head off. Waco Johnny Dean eventually gets what is coming to him after coming in contact with the ominous Winchester rifle. \n"
"\n"
"The main story of Winchester '73 is reminiscent of the mythological tale of Jason and his quest for the golden fleece, as told in Apollonius' Argonautica. Both stories deal with the acquisition of a sacred object that possesses some sort of intangible quality. Like Jason, Stewart's character hops from one adventure to the next in search of a one-of-a- kind prize. Another theme in Winchester '73 that is similar to a mythic tale is the struggle between brothers. Several stories of antiquity deal with this issue, such as the Hebrew Bible's tale of Cain and Abel, and the vulgate tale of Romulus and Remus. \n"
"\n"
"As for the theme of abduction and rape present in Anthony Mann's film, it is present in many mythological works, such as the rape of Europa as told by Ovid in his Metamorphoses. \n"
"\n"
"Winchester '73 is a fine example of the western genre, and acts as the objective correlative for many classic American western and ancient mythological themes.\n"
"Now, what is this review like?\n"

"The muffins in Michael's oven were almost ready when Ian showed up, so Michael excitedly beckoned him inside, eager to share this delightful treat he had been preparing. The sweet smell of freshly baked blueberry muffins filled the air, effortlessly creating a warm and inviting atmosphere in the cozy kitchen. Michael had arranged the ingredients and kitchen tools meticulously on the kitchen counter, showcasing his passion for baking and his craving for an organized workspace.\n"
"\n"
"As Michael checked on the muffins, a quiet 'ding' was heard as the oven timer announced that they had reached the perfect doneness. He opened the oven carefully, revealing two perfectly golden trays of the tastiest, fluffiest blueberry muffins one could ever imagine. With a proud smile, he pulled them out of the oven, placing the trays on the cooling rack for a few minutes. The aroma in the room intensified as the warm muffins released tiny plumes of steam, causing Ian's mouth to water in anticipation.\n"
"\n"
"Ian perched on a barstool near the kitchen island, enthusiastically waiting for the muffins to cool down. The two friends chatted idly about their day, their chatter accompanied by the soft sizzle of the cooling muffins, exuding a positive and uplifting energy that only good conversation and good food could create.\n"
"\n"
"The time had come to sample the fruits of Michael's labor. He elegantly plated two glossy, buttery muffins on small, porcelain plates for himself and Ian. Impatiently, they took their first bites, savoring the tender texture, the crunch of the slightly caramelized muffin tops, and the burst of natural sweetness from the plump blueberries. Their taste buds danced with joy upon finding the perfect balance between sweet and tangy, a testament to Michael's baking expertise.\n"
"\n"
"It was evident that the muffins were more than a delicious snack - they represented the bond between these two friends. The warmth, love, and dedication shared through baking proved that it was not just about the final product but about the process and memories created. As they continued to share stories and laughs between bites of the phenomenal muffins, it was truly a moment of connection and happiness that would stay with them long after the plates were empty and the muffins were gone.\n"
"\n"
"Time ticked by, and Ian could not keep quiet about how good the muffins were. He insisted Michael share his recipe with him so that he, too, could spread the love of blueberry muffins with friends and family. With a modest grin, Michael obliged and walked Ian through the meticulous details, resulting in the passing of not just a recipe but of an experience, a symbol of friendship and connection that would ultimately contribute to similar memories being built with more people in times to come.\n"
"\n"
"And so, through the simple act of baking and sharing muffins, a bond had been nourished, a connection solidified, and a memory etched into their hearts, to be cherished and revisited on countless occasions. Because, in the end, sometimes it's the little moments, like blueberry muffins shared between friends, that truly add flavor to life."

"The race in the AFC West continued to heat up in December, especially when the Chiefs took on the San Diego Chargers on prime-time national television.  The Chiefs entered the game fighting to keep their playoff dreams alive while the San Diego Chargers looked to secure the home field advantage in the playoffs. The game was scheduled to be broadcast on CBS at 1pm San Diego time, but on December 4, the game was officially chosen to be aired on NBC Sunday Night Football at 8:15 ET (6:15 San Diego time) as part of the league's new \"flex scheduling\" policy.  The game marked the first time the Chiefs appeared on NBC Sunday Night Football, their first prime-time game in San Diego, and their first game to be aired on NBC since facing Denver in the AFC Divisional Playoff Game at Arrowhead on January 4, 1998. Publicity fueled the Sunday night match when Chiefs defensive end Tamba Hali claimed the Chargers were a \"finesse team\" eight weeks ago after Kansas City beat San Diego 30-27 at Arrowhead Stadium in week 5.  The game was the last time the Chargers lost before their seven-game winning streak leading into week 14. Prior to kickoff, there was a video tribute and moment of silence for Hunt, who died Wednesday night of complications from prostate cancer. He was 74. The Chiefs had \"LH\" decals on the backs of their helmets.  The Chiefs opted for white pants in honor of Lamar Hunt. The Chiefs got their start in Kansas City wearing white on white when playing on the road and some players appealed to coach Herm Edwards to go to the traditional look Sunday night. After getting one sack in the previous two games and none in last week's loss to Baltimore, the Chiefs were able to put some pressure on Philip Rivers in the first half. James Reed and Tamba Hali each had a sack, and the Chiefs would have had a third, but Rivers was penalized for intentional grounding when he unloaded the ball.  The Chiefs did not allow Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers to complete a pass until early in the second quarter when he threw for 18&#160;yards to Vincent Jackson.  The Chargers still led 7-3 at the time. Tomlinson broke three NFL records: single-season scoring (186 points), single-season rushing touchdowns (28) and consecutive multitouchdown games (eight).  Tomlinson's 85-yard touchdown run in the second quarter was the game's deciding play. It gave the Chargers a 14-3 lead with less than 3&#160;minutes until halftime.  The Chiefs never recovered from the botched blocked punt and let the Chargers run away with their eleventh win of the season and homefield advantage in the playoffs. Trent Green finished the game 23 of 41 with 185&#160;yards passing, no touchdowns and one interception.  It was Green's fourth loss in six games after returning from his injury in week one.  Lawrence Tynes was the only scorer for the Chiefs, kicking three field goals from 45, 52 and 24&#160;yards out. The game was the Chiefs' third straight loss as they fell to 7-7 and the Chargers' eighth straight win as they improved to 12-2.\n"

"The given process describes the typical lifecycle of a butterfly, which involves the following stages:\n"
"\n"
"1. A larva, or caterpillar, is born from an egg.\n"
"2. The caterpillar eats constantly, growing bigger in the process.\n"
"3. The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself, also known as the chrysalis or pupal stage.\n"
"4. The caterpillar becomes a pupa and undergoes metamorphosis within the cocoon.\n"
"5. After some time, the cocoon hatches, and an adult butterfly emerges.\n"
"\n"
"Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis: the availability of food is reduced, and we must analyze the impact of this on the number of caterpillars that form cocoons and whether this perturbation has any direct or indirect effect on the process.\n"
"\n"
"While the perturbation hypothesis may have multiple outcomes, the most likely scenario is that it would lead to an overall decrease in the rate and number of caterpillars that form cocoons and subsequently transform into butterflies. This effect can result from several underlying factors:\n"
"\n"
"1. Starvation: As caterpillars rely on a constant supply of food to grow and develop, reduced availability of food would increase the chance of starvation before they can even reach the stage where they form a cocoon. A higher number of caterpillars might perish before forming cocoons, leaving fewer to make the transition and continue the lifecycle.\n"
"\n"
"2. Slower growth rate: With less food available, surviving caterpillars may not achieve the same rate of growth and development as they would in an environment with ample food. As a result, the time it takes for these caterpillars to reach the cocoon-forming stage could be prolonged. This delayed development might disrupt other aspects of the lifecycle, such as mating and reproduction patterns.\n"
"\n"
"3. Smaller size and compromised health: Reduced food intake may cause surviving caterpillars to grow at a slower rate and reach smaller final body sizes. Smaller size and suboptimal food intake could negatively impact their overall health, and this compromised health might, in turn, affect their ability to form a cocoon and complete metamorphosis successfully.\n"
"\n"
"4. Competition for food: With less food available, competition among caterpillars for resources becomes more intense. The caterpillars that are faster or better equipped to secure scarce food resources will have a better chance of surviving and forming cocoons, while others might not be as fortunate. The resulting selection pressure could lead to changes in the overall population dynamics and possibly even the evolution of specific traits or behaviors advantageous to those prevailing conditions.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis that suggests less food availability may lead to fewer caterpillars forming cocoons seems plausible. Reduced food in the caterpillar stage might have direct effects, such as starvation, slower growth, and compromised health, leading to a decreased number of cocoons formed. Indirect effects can include intensified competition for food resources, which could impact the overall population dynamics and shape the evolution of the species."

"Title: Bosnian Vice President Disagrees with Conference Proposal\n"
"\n"
"The Bosnian Vice President has recently issued a statement rejecting the idea of an international conference aimed at addressing the political, economic, and social issues faced by the region. In a move that surprised many, the Vice President made it clear that they do not believe a conference is currently the best solution for achieving sustainable development and fostering unity in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n"
"\n"
"For several years, Bosnia and Herzegovina has faced growing internal challenges ranging from lingering ethnic divisions to bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption. Analysts have often called for a review of the Dayton Agreement of 1995, which put an end to the Bosnian War but left behind a complicated and often ineffective power-sharing system between the three major ethnic groups in the country: Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats.\n"
"\n"
"Amidst these concerns, some believe that an international conference could help showcase the nation's progress since the 1990s and enable the country to refocus its efforts on critical issues that hinder its path to development. Advocates for the conference have argued that input from external experts, along with Bosnian decision-makers, could provide valuable insights on tackling pressing issues such as economic stagnation, high unemployment rates, and infrastructure development.\n"
"\n"
"However, the Bosnian Vice President's recent dismissal of the conference proposal suggests an alternative path towards resolving these problems. In the statement, the Vice President emphasized the importance of finding \"homegrown solutions and relying on the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\" They argued that an international conference could be perceived as external interference in the nation's affairs, which may not be received well by all parties involved.\n"
"\n"
"The Vice President also highlighted that Bosnia and Herzegovina has made significant strides in recent years, in spite of its numerous challenges. The statement underscored the progress achieved in establishing more transparent governance structures, reducing corruption, and streamlining administrative processes. While acknowledging that much more needs to be done, the Vice President maintained confidence in the ability of the Bosnian people to strengthen their society and institutions.\n"
"\n"
"The rejection of the conference idea has prompted various reactions from both domestic and international stakeholders. Some have criticized the Vice President's position as a denial of valuable opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing, while others have applauded the emphasis on self-reliance and the nurturing of local expertise.\n"
"\n"
"In the coming weeks, it remains to be seen how the government and the public will react to this statement and whether the momentum behind the conference proposal will continue to gather steam. As Bosnia and Herzegovina works to resolve its longstanding issues, the delicate balance between seeking external assistance and relying on internal resources will undoubtedly be at the forefront of the political conversation."

"\n"
"On the other hand, Natalie never had a significant interest in attending checkups or consulting with doctors. She often found herself feeling uneasy about the whole process, questioning the utility of such visits, and wondering if the cost and time spent were worth it.\n"
"\n"
"The two friends had often discussed their differing perspectives on the matter. Betty would explain the comfort and reassurance that came with knowing a medical expert was tracking her health, helping her to catch any potential issues early on, and providing guidance on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle. She felt that her regular checkups were a critical component of her self-care routine and appreciated the peace of mind that they provided.\n"

She felt that she knew her body better than anyone else and could sense when something was wrong, relying on her intuition to guide her when making decisions about her health. While Natalie appreciated Betty's perspective, she couldn't help but feel skeptical about whether regular doctor visits and consultations were truly helping Betty or just creating a false sense of security.\n"

She was aware of the latest information about health issues and concerns, which made her feel confident about her choices and allowed her to stay ahead of any potential problems. This proactive approach to health helped her forge a lifestyle that suited her interests while giving her the sense of security and control she desired.\n"
