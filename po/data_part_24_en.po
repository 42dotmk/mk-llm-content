"Indeed, all these human tendencies and phenomena are, as yet, still embryonic. This statement suggests that there are many aspects of human behavior, cognition, emotion, and social organization that are currently in the early stages of development or understanding. While some tendencies and phenomena are well-established and thoroughly understood, there is still an immense amount of uncharted territory waiting to be discovered and studied.\n"
"\n"
"In particular, human cognition and the brain – our most complex and intricate organ – continue to elicit fascination and inquiry from researchers around the world. As advancements in neuroimaging and other techniques unfold, we are beginning to uncover new information about how the brain functions, processes information, and adapts to change. Despite these advances, there is still much to learn about the intricacies of the brain and the true scope of our mental capacities.\n"
"\n"
"Moreover, the rapid pace of technological progress in recent years has led to new paradigms in the realm of human communication, interaction, and learning. We now have access to a wealth of knowledge and resources at our fingertips through the internet, which has proven to be both empowering and overwhelming. Our ability to navigate this digital landscape and adapt to changes in technology is, in many ways, still at an early stage of development.\n"
"\n"
"Similarly, our understanding of human emotions and their influence on our decision-making and behavior is continually evolving. While we have identified basic emotions and some of their impacts on our lives, neuroscientists and psychologists are still exploring more nuanced emotions, their interrelationships, and effects on the human psyche. Recent advances in emotional intelligence research have provided insights into managing emotions effectively to improve relationships, decision-making processes, and overall well-being. However, many facets of our emotional landscape remain underexplored.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, as our world becomes increasingly interconnected, we are continually exposed to different cultures, languages, beliefs, and social norms. Understanding and embracing this diversity can contribute to global harmony and prosperity. This, too, is a process that is in its infancy, with significant obstacles and misconceptions still hindering our progress in fostering cross-cultural understanding and collaboration.\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, the looming threat of climate change and environmental issues provide another area where human behavior, mentality, and awareness need significant growth and development. We are beginning to understand the implications of our actions on the environment, but the pace of change in our behaviors, policies, and technologies has yet to catch up with the urgency of the situation.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the statement that \"all these human tendencies and phenomena are, as yet, still embryonic\" highlights the immense potential for growth and development in various aspects of our lives. As we continue to expand our knowledge and understanding of ourselves and the world around us, we must seize the opportunity to evolve and adapt. By doing so, we can overcome the myriad challenges facing humanity and strive to create a better world for future generations."

"Ronald Ernest Paul (born August 20, 1935) is an American author, physician and retired politician who served as the U.S. Representative for Texas's 22nd congressional district from 1976 to 1977 and again from 1979 to 1985, and for Texas's 14th congressional district from 1997 to 2013. On three occasions, he sought the presidency of the United States: as the Libertarian Party nominee in 1988 and as a candidate in the Republican primaries of 2008 and 2012. Paul is a critic of the federal government's fiscal policies, especially the existence of the Federal Reserve and the tax policy, as well as the military-industrial complex, and the War on Drugs. He has also been a vocal critic of mass surveillance policies such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the NSA surveillance programs.\n"
"\n"
"Paul served in Congress three different periods: first from 1976 to 1977, after he won a special election, then from 1979 to 1985, and finally from 1997 to 2013.  In his early years, Paul served on the House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for inflation and spoke against the banking mismanagement that resulted in the savings and loan crisis. Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the US from 1873-1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue. He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress.  During his first term, Paul founded the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education (FREE), a non-profit think tank dedicated to promoting principles of limited government and free-market economics. In 1984, Paul became the first chairman of the Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), a conservative political group founded by Charles and David Koch \"to fight for less government, lower taxes, and less regulation.\" CSE started a Tea Party protest against high taxes in 2002. In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into two new organizations, with Citizens for a Sound Economy being renamed as FreedomWorks, and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation becoming Americans for Prosperity. The two organizations would become key players in the Tea Party movement from 2009 onward.  Paul proposed term-limit legislation multiple times, while himself serving four terms in the House of Representatives. In 1984, he decided to retire from the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate, complaining in his House farewell address that \"Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare... It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic.\" Paul lost the Republican primary to Phil Gramm, who had switched parties the previous year from Democrat to Republican. Another candidate of the senatorial primary was Henry Grover, a conservative former state legislator who had lost the 1972 gubernatorial general election to the Democrat Dolph Briscoe, Jr.  On Paul's departure from the House, his seat was assumed by former state representative Tom DeLay, who would later become House Majority Leader."

"Question: Donna worked 2 hours every morning walking dogs in her neighborhood for $10.00 an hour. 5 days a week, after school, she worked at a card shop for 2 hours and made $12.50 an hour. On the weekends, she usually made $10.00 an hour babysitting and was guaranteed 4 hours every Saturday from her neighbor. How much money did she make over 7 days?\n"
"Answer: She makes $10.00 an hour for 2 hours walking dogs so she makes 10 * 2 = $20.00 every morning. Over 7 days she makes 7 * 20 = $140.00 a week. She makes $12.50 for 2 hours working at a card shop so she makes 12.5 * 2 = $25.00. She works there 5 days a week so she makes 5 * 25 = $125.00 a week. She also babysits for 4 hours making $10.00 an hour for a total of 4 * 10 = $40.00. Over 7 days, she makes 140 + 125 + 40 = $305.00. The answer is 305.\n"

"[Answer]First find the total soaking time to get rid of the grass stains: 4 minutes / stain * 3 stains = 12 minutes. Then add the soak time for the marinara to find the total soak time: 12 minutes + 7 minutes = 19 minutes. The answer is 19.\n"
"Q: Out of the 300 comic books in a comic store, 30% are liked by females, males like 120, and both genders don't like the rest. What percentage of the comic books are disliked by both males and females?\n"
"A: The number of comic books that females like is 30 / 100 * 300 = 90 books. Together, both males and females like 90 + 120 = 210 comic books. The number of comic books that are disliked by both males and females is 300 - 210 = 90. The percentage of books that are disliked by both genders is 90 / 300 * 100 = 30%. The answer is 30.\n"
"Question: Jack has been driving for the past 9 years. He drives 37,000 miles every four months. How many miles has Jack driven since he started driving?\n"

"[Question]Bill milked his cow and got 16 gallons of milk. He turned 1/4 into sour cream, 1/4 into butter, and kept the rest as whole milk. It takes 4 gallons of milk to make one gallon of butter and 2 gallons of milk to make 1 gallon of sour cream. If Bill sells butter for $5/gallon, sour cream for $6/gallon, and whole milk for $3/gallon, how much money does he make?\n"
"[Answer]First find how much milk Bill turned into sour cream and butter: 16 gallons * 1 / 4 = 4 gallons. Then find how many gallons of butter he makes out of 4 gallons of milk: 4 gallons milk / 4 gallons milk / 1 gallon butter = 1 gallon butter. Then find how many gallons of sour cream he makes out of 4 gallons of milk: 4 gallons milk / 2 gallons milk / 1 gallon sour cream = 2 gallon sour cream. Then subtract the amount of milk turned into butter and sour cream to find the remaining amount of whole milk: 16 gallons - 4 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons. Then multiply the number of gallons of milk by the price of milk to find the total cost of the milk: 8 gallons * $3 / gallon = $24. Then multiply the number of gallons of sour cream by the price of sour cream to find the total cost of the sour cream: 2 gallons * $6 / gallon = $12. Then add the cost of the butter, sour cream and milk to find the total amount of money Bill earns: $24 + $12 + $5 = $41. The answer is 41.\n"

"The type of tree you grow should be reliant on the environment where you'll be keeping it. Your region's climate and your home environment should both be taken into account when you're deciding which species of tree to grow. To be on the safe side, select a species that is indigenous to your part of the world.  Deciduous species such as Chinese or Japanese elms, magnolias, oaks, and crabapple trees are good selections if you'd like to grow your bonsai outside. Just be sure to pick out a species that can grow to full size in your region.  If you prefer coniferous trees, junipers, pines, spruces, or cedars all make excellent choices. If you want to grow a tree indoors (or if you live in a hot climate), consider a tropical species. Jade, snowrose, and olive trees may be grown as bonsais. Planting a bonsai tree from seed is a slow but rewarding process. If you plant a tree, you'll have to allow it time to take root and grow strong before you can begin trimming and training. Depending on the species of tree you grow, this could take up to five years. Many find the extra wait and effort to be worth it since seeds are so inexpensive and the grower is able to control the tree at every stage of growth. To grow a bonsai from seed, take the following steps:  Buy a package of bonsai tree seeds. Soak them overnight before planting them in soil with good drainage and the right nutrient composition for your tree species. Plant the tree in a training container (as opposed to a ceramic display container, which is only used once the tree has been trained and reached maturity). Give the planted tree the correct amount of sun, water, and a consistent temperature, again dictated by the specific species of tree. Allow the tree to become sturdy and strong before you begin to train it. This method of acquiring a bonsai tree is highly valued, since caring for a bonsai tree you find in the wild requires a lot of skill and knowledge. If collecting a tree that has had its start in nature appeals to you, consider the following factors:  Select a tree with a sturdy trunk, but one that is still quite young. Older trees won't adapt well to being placed in a container. Choose a tree with roots that spread evenly in every direction, rather than growing laterally or entangled with the roots of other trees. Dig around the tree and extract a large amount of soil along with the roots. This will prevent the tree from dying of shock when it is moved to a container. Plant the tree in a large training container. Care for it according to the needs of the particular species. Wait about a year for the roots to get used to the container before you begin training it. This is the easiest way to begin the art of bonsai, but it is also the most expensive. Bonsai trees that have been grown from seed and partially trained have already received a lot of time and care, so they are usually quite pricey. Look online and in local nurseries and plant shops for a bonsai tree to bring home with you.  If you buy a partially-trained bonsai from a shop, talk with the person who trained it about its specific needs. When you bring the bonsai home, give it a few weeks to adjust to the new setting before you begin working with it."

I remember rushing to my bedroom, taking out my binoculars, racing back to the kitchen and spotting the image of a glass shattered bus. The bus was still near the pick up station where a terrorist boarded on it and with a single click on a TNT device, murdered 25 passengers, many of whom were on their way to school.

"As the detective progresses in his investigation, his observations are permeating into the play and later on, to the lives of its actors. In the meantime, the play metamorphoses from a comic play into an indictment against the aloofness of the Israeli society. As for the movie, well, the movie becomes an exercise in frenzy editing, ensconced in its petty cardboard characters and unreliable dialogs while drifting miles away from the subject it was supposed to deal with in the first place.\n"
"\n"
"When I say \"cardboard characters\" I refer to the characters that under the writer/director's obsession for a \"meaningful\" film, were devoid of any genuine dialogs and any shred of reliability. I won't elaborate too much about it. Suffice to say that I'm sure that homeless barefoot male prostitutes rarely go the theater. With the intention to see a play, that is.\n"

"Background: Immanuel Kant (; German: [I'ma:nue:l kant]; 22 April 1724 - 12 February 1804) was a German philosopher who is a central figure in modern philosophy. Kant argues that the human mind creates the structure of human experience, that reason is the source of morality, that aesthetics arises from a faculty of disinterested judgment, that space and time are forms of human sensibility, and that the world as it is \"in-itself\" is independent of humanity's concepts of it. Kant took himself to have effected a \"Copernican revolution\" in philosophy, akin to Copernicus' reversal of the age-old belief that the sun revolves around the earth.\n"
"Context: In \"Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch\", Kant listed several conditions that he thought necessary for ending wars and creating a lasting peace. They included a world of constitutional republics. His classical republican theory was extended in the Science of Right, the first part of the Metaphysics of Morals (1797). Kant believed that universal history leads to the ultimate world of republican states at peace, but his theory was not pragmatic. The process was described in \"Perpetual Peace\" as natural rather than rational:  The guarantee of perpetual peace is nothing less than that great artist, nature...In her mechanical course we see that her aim is to produce a harmony among men, against their will, and indeed through their discord. As a necessity working according to laws we do not know, we call it destiny. But, considering its designs in universal history, we call it \"providence,\" inasmuch as we discern in it the profound wisdom of a higher cause which predetermines the course of nature and directs it to the objective final end of the human race.  Kant's political thought can be summarized as republican government and international organization. \"In more characteristically Kantian terms, it is doctrine of the state based upon the law (Rechtsstaat) and of eternal peace. Indeed, in each of these formulations, both terms express the same idea: that of legal constitution or of 'peace through law'. Taken simply by itself, Kant's political philosophy, being essentially a legal doctrine, rejects by definition the opposition between moral education and the play of passions as alternate foundations for social life. The state is defined as the union of men under law. The state rightly so called is constituted by laws which are necessary a priori because they flow from the very concept of law. A regime can be judged by no other criteria nor be assigned any other functions, than those proper to the lawful order as such.\"  He opposed \"democracy,\" which at his time meant direct democracy, believing that majority rule posed a threat to individual liberty. He stated, \"...democracy is, properly speaking, necessarily a despotism, because it establishes an executive power in which 'all' decide for or even against one who does not agree; that is, 'all,' who are not quite all, decide, and this is a contradiction of the general will with itself and with freedom.\" As with most writers at the time, he distinguished three forms of government i.e. democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy with mixed government as the most ideal form of it.\n"

"Title: Victims of Northern Ireland's Bloodiest Bomb Attack Seek Justice as They Sue Alleged Real IRA Chieftains\n"
"\n"
"In a relentless pursuit to attain justice for the lives lost and the devastation caused by the 1998 Omagh bombing, victims and their families have taken legal action against the alleged leaders of the dissident Republican group - the Real Irish Republican Army (Real IRA). The Omagh bombing is known as the deadliest single incident of \"the Troubles,\" a three-decade-long period of conflict, violence, and political unrest in Northern Ireland.\n"
"\n"
"On August 15, 1998, a powerful car bomb with an estimated 500lb of explosives went off in Omagh, a small town in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. The catastrophic explosion resulted in the gruesome killing of 29 innocent people, including a woman pregnant with twins, and injuring over 200 others. The Real IRA, a dissident Republican group opposed to the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement of the same year, claimed responsibility for the blood-curdling attack.\n"
"\n"
"In the aftermath of the tragedy, the victims' families began their fight for justice, seeking to hold the individuals responsible for the attack accountable. The case eventually led to a landmark civil legal action in 2009, where four men were found liable for the bombing and ordered to pay £1.6m in damages. However, only one of the defendants faced a criminal conviction – a former Real IRA leader identified as Seamus Daly was tried in 2016 and ultimately acquitted of all charges.\n"
"\n"
"Despite the legal setbacks, the victims' resolve has only grown, and their fight for justice continues. The civil case recently took a significant turn as the victims and their families have now sued two suspected Real IRA chieftains, aiming to make them accountable for the destruction, pain, and loss they allegedly orchestrated.\n"
"\n"
"The two individuals are believed to have been prominent figures in planning and executing the Omagh bombing, and their prosecution could potentially bring a measure of justice and closure to the families and the entire Omagh community. With the legal battle ongoing, the victims and their families remain hopeful that they can finally secure justice for all those who were heartlessly slain and forever altered by the tragedy that unfolded more than two decades ago.\n"
"\n"
"The Omagh bombing's painful memories serve as a haunting reminder of the brutality of \"the Troubles\" and a plea to prevent any such acts of violence and terrorism from happening again. In their legal pursuit for truth and justice, the victims and their families demonstrate unwavering resilience, sending a strong message to those who would perpetrate violence that they will be held accountable for their actions.\n"
"\n"
"As Northern Ireland has come a long way since the dark days of \"the Troubles,\" the unity, strength, and perseverance shown by the victims of the Omagh bombing offer hope that the wounds of the past can heal, and lasting peace can be achieved. While no legal action can fully restore the lives lost or repair the damage caused by the Omagh attack, the persistent quest for justice serves as a testament to the human spirit's indomitability, paving the way for a brighter future based on truth, accountability, and reconciliation."

"What role has Florida played in the development and growth of the U.S. space program?\n"
"\n"
"Florida has played a crucial role in the development and growth of the United States space program. The state's first involvement with the space program started during the early stages of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1950s. Since then, Florida has continued to contribute and expand its involvement in the world of space exploration.\n"
"\n"
"One of the main reasons Florida has been such an essential player in the U.S. space program is because of its ideal geographic location. The state's proximity to the equator allows rockets to benefit from the Earth's rotational speed, making it easier and more fuel-efficient to reach the desired orbits. Florida's coastline facing the Atlantic Ocean also provides a safe and unobstructed launch path for space missions.\n"
"\n"
"Cape Canaveral in Florida has been a key location for the U.S. space program. The Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was established in 1948 as a missile test facility. By 1958, the first United States satellite, Explorer 1, was launched into space from this location. Since then, numerous space missions and projects have been developed and executed from Cape Canaveral and the surrounding areas.\n"
"\n"
"The John F. Kennedy Space Center, also located on Florida's east coast, is arguably one of the most iconic elements of the U.S. space program. Established in 1962 as the nation's primary launch center for human spaceflight, the Kennedy Space Center has played host to some of the most iconic space missions in history. This includes the legendary Apollo 11 mission which successfully landed humans on the moon for the first time in 1969.\n"
"\n"
"Florida's Space Coast, where both Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Kennedy Space Center are located, has seen the launch of numerous iconic spacecraft such as the Saturn V rockets for the Apollo missions and the Space Shuttle program that operated from 1981 until 2011. The Space Coast is still in use today for launches of private aerospace companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance.\n"
"\n"
"In addition to the Kennedy Space Center, Florida is also home to other organizations and aerospace companies that are involved in the space industry. For example, the Space Florida agency was established in 2006 to promote the growth of Florida's aerospace sector, attract investment, and facilitate business development.\n"
"\n"
"Florida's colleges and universities, such as the University of Florida and the Florida Institute of Technology, play a significant role in developing the next generation of engineers and scientists to support the growth and development of the U.S. space program. These institutions provide cutting-edge research and innovation in the fields of aerospace engineering, astronautics, and other space-related fields.\n"
"\n"
"In summary, Florida has been an integral part of the U.S. space program due to its prime geographic location, historic launch facilities, higher education institutions, and collaboration with private companies. The state's ongoing contributions to space exploration and development are a testament to Florida's role in shaping the future of human spaceflight and innovative aerospace industries."

During his balloon ride, he pulled the chain for 15 minutes, then released the rope for 10 minutes, then pulled the chain for another 15 minutes, and finally released the chain and allowed the balloon to slowly descend back to the earth. During his balloon ride, what was the highest elevation reached by the balloon?\n"
"A: The first 15 - minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise 50 * 15 = 750 feet. Releasing the chain for 10 minutes caused the balloon to descend 10 * 10 = 100 feet. The second 15 - minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise another 50 * 15 = 750 feet.

"In a bicycle competition, men are lined up and ready to race. What most naturally follows is the series of events and processes that take place during a typical bicycle race competition. Let's break it down into various stages and aspects of the race:\n"
"\n"
"1. Pre-race preparations: Prior to the start of the competition, participants would have completed their registration process and collected their race numbers. They will have also checked their bikes to ensure that they are in good working order and complied with any equipment regulations. The race organizers would have set up the race course, including markings and safety measures, such as placing barriers, marshals, and first aid stations along the route.\n"
"\n"
"2. Strategies and planning: Riders and their teams would have developed race strategies tailored to the specific conditions of the competition, such as the route, weather, terrain, and their individual strengths and weaknesses. Some riders may aim to go for an early breakaway, while others may want to ride in the peloton (main group) and conserve energy for a sprint finish.\n"
"\n"
"3. The starting line: Riders would have warmed up and assembled at the starting line, prepared to begin the race. The race official would make any last-minute announcements, and the countdown to the start will commence. Once the starting gun or whistle is sounded, the race begins.\n"
"\n"
"4. The race: Throughout the race, individual riders and teams will contend for positions and may attempt to break away from the main group to gain an advantage.

"Background: Wladyslaw Gomulka (Polish: [vwa'diswaf go'muwka]; 6 February 1905 - 1 September 1982) was a Polish communist politician. He was the de facto leader of post-war Poland until 1948. Following the Polish October he became leader again from 1956 to 1970. Gomulka was initially very popular for his reforms; his seeking a \"Polish way to socialism\"; and giving rise to the period known as \"Gomulka's thaw\".\n"
"Context: In the fall of 1943, the PPR leadership began discussing the creation of a Polish quasi-parliamentary, communist-led body, to be named the State National Council (Krajowa Rada Narodowa, KRN). After the Battle of Kursk the expectation was of a Soviet victory and liberation of Poland and the PPR wanted to be ready to assume power. Gomulka came up with the idea of a national council and imposed his point of view on the rest of the leadership. The PPR intended to obtain consent from the Cominterm leader and their Soviet contact Georgi Dimitrov. However, in November the Gestapo arrested Finder and Malgorzata Fornalska, who possessed the secret codes for communication with Moscow and the Soviet response remained unknown. In the absence of Finder, on 23 November Gomulka was elected general secretary (chief) of the PPR and Bierut joined the three-person inner leadership.  The founding meeting of the State National Council took place in the late evening of 31 December 1943. The new body's chairman Bierut was becoming Gomulka's main rival. In mid-January 1944 Dimitrov was finally informed of the KRN's existence, which surprised both him and the Polish communist leaders in Moscow, increasingly led by Jakub Berman, who had other, competing ideas concerning the establishment of a Polish communist ruling party and government.  Gomulka felt that the Polish communists in occupied Poland had a better understanding of Polish realities than their brethren in Moscow and that the State National Council should determine the shape of the future executive government of Poland. Nevertheless, to gain a Soviet approval and to clear any misunderstandings a KRN delegation left Warsaw in mid-March heading for Moscow, where it arrived two months later. By that time Stalin concluded that the existence of the KRN was a positive development and the Poles arriving from Warsaw were received and greeted by him and other Soviet dignitaries. The Union of Polish Patriots and the Central Bureau of Polish Communists in Moscow were now under pressure to recognize the primacy of the PPR, the KRN and Wladyslaw Gomulka, which they ultimately did only in mid-July.  On 20 July, the Soviet forces under Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky forced their way across the Bug River and on that same day the combined meeting of Polish communists from the Moscow and Warsaw factions finalized the arrangements regarding the establishment (on 21 July) of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN), a temporary government headed by Edward Osobka-Morawski, a socialist allied with the communists. Gomulka and other PPR leaders left Warsaw and headed for the Soviet-controlled territory, arriving in Lublin on 1 August, the day the Warsaw Uprising erupted in the Polish capital.\n"

"5 tips for making perfect corned beef\n"
"\n"
"St. Patrick’s Day fare traditionally includes corned beef, but this savory specialty can be prepared any time of the year. You can add corned beef to sandwiches, casseroles and eggs for a delicious meal. Here are five tips to making the heartiest, yummiest corned beef:\n"
"\n"
"Corned beef is traditionally made using brisket, which is taken from the cow’s front breast section. Since the cow usually exercises these parts, the precooked cuts are relatively lean. When possible, try to buy fresh meat directly from a butcher, instead of pre-packaged cuts. If you do have to use packaged meat, keep an eye out for a high grade. To select a good cut, first make sure the meat has a deep red color. Avoid graying meat, as that likely means the cut has been refrigerated for too long. You should also look out for a nice layer of fat over the meat. Note that the meat will shrink as you cook, so pick up generous portions.\n"
"\n"
"Brisket usually comes in point cuts or flat cuts. Point cuts are rounder and have more marbling, which means you can get more flavor and juiciness from the fat. The leaner flat cuts are easier to slice uniformly. Choose the cut that best fits your needs. While point cuts may be tastier, well-cooked flat cuts offer a great deal of flavor. Leftover flat cuts are usually better for making sandwiches, since the lean meat slices and dices so cleanly.\n"
"\n"
"The less tender cuts of meat require slow, moist cooking to achieve their full potential. Excessively high heat will only make your meat tough, so make sure to simmer slowly. Your cooking time will depend on the amount of meat you are preparing. A good time gauge is approximately 50 minutes for every pound of beef, but you should keep an eye on it and simply stop when the meat is nice and tender. Cooking too long can cause the meat to fall apart, which is worse for sandwiches. To be on the safe side, U.S. Food and Safety Inspection recommends cooking raw corned beef to a minimum of 145 degrees Fahrenheit. In short, give yourself a lot of time, since the simmering process can take as long as 5 hours. Munch on a lot of snacks, as the anticipation of cooking corned beef will definitely whet your appetite.\n"
"\n"
"Don’t be shy about spice\n"
"\n"
"Corned beef often comes with a packet of spices, but you may want to start from scratch. You can pick up a pickling spice blend from the grocery store or make one up from your own spice rack. Common corned beef spices include peppercorn, bay leaves, allspice, cinnamon, ginger, coriander, cloves, nutmeg and mustard seed. You can also throw in some fresh garlic for added flavor. If you have purchased packaged corned beef brisket, the beef may already be seasoned. Cook a small piece to find out whether you still need to add spices.\n"
"\n"
"If you are looking for that extra kick, a glass of beer might do the trick. The beer will soak in and infuse your meat with flavor while adding moisture. Opt for an Irish stout beer, but be aware that stronger varieties can be bitter. As a complement to the beer flavor, season your corned beef with brown sugar. Once your meal is ready, you can easily pair the corned beef dish with your beer for a sublime St. Patrick’s Day (or any day) dinner.\n"

"Gregory John Norman AO (born 10 February 1955) is an Australian professional golfer and entrepreneur who spent 331 weeks as the world's Number 1 Official World Golf Rankings ranked golfer in the 1980s and 1990s. He has won 91 international tournaments, including 20 PGA Tour tournaments and two majors: The Open Championships in 1986 and 1993. Norman also earned thirty top-10 finishes and was the runner-up 8 times in majors throughout his career.\n"
"\n"
"Norman endured another setback at the 1987 Masters. In his final round on the 18th green, Norman had a 20-foot putt for a birdie that would win the tournament. The ball trickled over the left lip of the cup, missing by millimetres. After Norman's par on the 72nd hole at Augusta, he found himself in a sudden-death playoff with Larry Mize and Seve Ballesteros. On the second playoff hole, with Ballesteros eliminated, Mize holed a 47-yard (140-foot) chip to win the tournament. Norman did, however, win the Australian Masters in February 1987 and the Australian Open later in the year by a record ten shots at Royal Melbourne Golf Club, beating the previous Australian Open record winning margin of eight strokes by Jack Nicklaus in 1971. Norman's 1987 victory at the Australian Open lifted him back above Seve Ballesteros to the top of the Official World Golf Ranking.  Norman had another four wins in Australia in 1988. In the U.S., Norman won the MCI Heritage Golf Classic at Hilton Head Island, South Carolina in April 1988, inspired by a leukemia-stricken teenager who got his wish to meet Norman and watch him play. The teenager was only supposed to watch the golfer for two rounds, but Norman arranged for him to stay until the tournament's completion. After the tournament, Norman awarded the teen with the trophy. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in that year.  At the 1989 Masters, Norman missed a 12-foot par putt on the 72nd hole which would have put him into a playoff with Nick Faldo and Scott Hoch. Norman had another chance at a major in 1989, this time at the Open Championship at Royal Troon. He played a final-round of 64, starting his round with six straight birdies, to force his way into a playoff with Mark Calcavecchia and Wayne Grady. Going into the final playoff hole, Norman and Calcavecchia were tied, but two successive bunker shots by Norman gave Calcavecchia the victory.  Norman won the Doral-Ryder Open and Memorial Tournament in March 1990 after having missed the cut for the first time at the 1990 Masters. In the 1990 Open Championship at St Andrews, Norman began with two rounds of 66, leaving himself sharing the lead with Nick Faldo after 36 holes and the pair four shots ahead of the rest of the field. Faldo then shot a third round of 67, but Norman could only manage 76. Norman finished the tournament tied for sixth place, while Faldo won by five shots. Although 1990 was not Norman's strongest majors year, he finished at the top of the PGA Tour money list for the second time in his career and won the Vardon Trophy and Byron Nelson Award. Later that year, he won the Australian Masters in his home country for a final and record sixth time.Answer this question using a quote from the following article:\n"

"For about a week, the nation's Catholic bishops enjoyed some measure of their bygone political clout. The bishops launched a vigorous grassroots campaign to protest a rule from the Obama administration's health care mandate that would force many Catholic institutions to cover birth control through their employee health plans. Catholic churchgoers have seen such campaigns attempted before, with bishops issuing stinging denunciations that are repeated in church publications and in letters read to parishioners at every Mass. But this time, to the surprise of many, the bishops' effort seemed to work. President Barack Obama quickly modified the rule. He didn't satisfy the bishops -- but still, the clergymen had upset the political calculus that they no longer affect Catholic voters. The bishops were able to wield influence because their message against the contraception mandate was framed in a way that appealed to a broad spectrum of Catholics. For moderates and liberals, there were calls to freedom and conscience, rather than blunt declarations to heed ecclesial authority. For conservatives, there was the opportunity to circle the wagons against secularism. But if the bishops insist on coming across as shrill and partisan, as some are wont to do, they'll wind up once again preaching to half the choir. Moderate and liberal Catholics won't stand behind the bishops if they perceive a partisan position. And it won't take much to trigger that reaction because certain bishops were transparently opposed to Obama during the 2008 election campaign, and many more of them later maligned the University of Notre Dame for granting the president an honorary degree. I noticed a letter to the editor in the diocesan newspaper in Brooklyn, where I live, that captures the unease I believe a good number of Catholics feel. The writer said she understood the church's position on the birth-control mandate, but she practically pleaded with the editor, who had accused the Obama administration of pushing socialism, to take a less polarizing tone. If the bishops really want to gain back some of the clout they used to hold, they would do well to consider the community organizing tactics that their own parishes have adopted in many poor urban neighborhoods. It is an approach that relies heavily on building consensus. Guided by the writings of Saul Alinsky, coalitions of houses of worship have organized around specific issues, such as a plan to build low-cost housing. The community organizers' first step was to secure the enthusiastic support of parishioners, demonstrated through massive rallies. Once pastors really do speak for their people, they are then in a position to demand that elected officials of whatever party support their agenda. Obama once was a community organizer for just such a church-funded coalition, working from a Catholic rectory on Chicago's South Side. Like the Chicago politicians he encountered as a young man, Obama knows that a church's grassroots campaign is only as effective as it is unified. I'm not sure how many bishops know that.

"- It showcases complex themes such as betrayal, trust, and the unpredictable nature of war, which can resonate with audiences.\n"
"\n"
"Weaknesses:\n"
"- The movie was released in 1978, which could make its appeal to modern audiences somewhat reliant on nostalgia or historical interest.\n"
"- Some plot elements, like impersonators and switching identities, might be less appealing or considered clichéd in modern films.\n"
"- The movie's use of various locations across Eastern Europe and Italy might require a substantial budget for set design, locations, and period-appropriate props.\n"

"Q: Mia is buying Christmas gifts for her family. She has spent $30 on each of her 3 siblings, and the rest of her spending was for her parents. If Mia spent a total of $150 on Christmas gifts and each of her parents received gifts of equal value, how much money, in dollars, did she spend on each parent’s gift?\n"
"A: Mia spent a total of $30 per siblings * 3 siblings = $90 on her siblings. She therefore spent $150 total spending - $90 spending on her siblings = $60 on her parents. As each parent received an equal amount, each parent’s gift cost $60 total spending on parents / 2 = $30. The answer is 30.\n"
"Question: Marianne was 20 years old when Bella was 8 years old. How old will Marianne be when Bella turns 18?\n"
"Answer: Marianne is 20 - 8 = 12 years older than Bella. Bella will turn 18 in 18 - 8 = 10 years. So, Marianne will be 20 + 10 = 30 years old then. The answer is 30.\n"
"[Question]A florist is making bouquets for the weekend. The florist uses red, yellow, orange, and purple flowers, and each bouquet contains 9 flowers of any color combinations. This week he planted 125 seeds for each color of flower. Unfortunately, a fungus killed 45 red flowers, 61 yellow, 30 orange, and 40 purple flowers. How many bouquets can the florist make this weekend?\n"
"[Answer]There were 125 seeds planted for each of the 4 colors of flower, so there were 125 * 4 = 500 flowers planted. The fungus killed 25 red, 31 yellow, 30 orange, and 40 purple flowers, 45 + 61 + 30 + 40 = 176 flowers dead. This leaves 500 - 176 = 324 flowers for the bouquets. If the florist puts 9 flowers in each bouquet, he can make 324 / 9 = 36 bouquets this weekend. The answer is 36.\n"

"Step 1: Introduce the protagonist, Linus, and establish the importance of his blanket\n"
"Our protagonist, Linus, is a young man in his 20s who has had an intense emotional attachment to a particular blanket since childhood. The blanket is an old, worn, and frayed, yet intricately woven piece passed down through generations in his family. Linus relies on his blanket for comfort during times of stress and uncertainty.\n"
"\n"
"Step 2: Create a dramatic event that separates Linus from his blanket\n"
"One day, while Linus is out, his apartment catches on fire due to an electrical fault. Linus returns home to find his apartment in ruins and his beloved blanket destroyed. Devastated, Linus goes through the motions of life but is overwhelmed by anxiety and loss without his security blanket.\n"
"\n"
"Step 3: Introduce a supporting character who pushes Linus to cope with the loss\n"
"Linus's best friend, Emily, who has been supportive of him throughout their friendship, notices that Linus has changed since the loss of his blanket. She encourages Linus to face his fears by suggesting therapy to help cope with his withdrawal symptoms and anxiety.\n"
"\n"
"Step 4: Present a goal for Linus - recreate the blanket\n"
"As part of his therapy, Linus's therapist suggests that he could rebuild the connection he had with the blanket by learning how to weave and recreating the blanket himself. Linus starts attending a weaving class, reluctantly at first, but slowly becomes more engrossed in the process.\n"
"\n"
"Step 5: Introduce a subplot - Linus discovers the origin of the blanket\n"
"Linus finds a small, undamaged piece of his original blanket among the charred remains of his apartment and realizes that the design on the blanket is actually a map. Intrigued, Linus traces his family's history and discovers that his ancestors were skilled weavers who used their talents to hide vital information (like maps) within their creations.\n"
"\n"
"Step 6: Introduce a conflict - Linus must choose between recreating the blanket or revealing the map to its intended recipients\n"
"Linus learns that the map woven into his ancestral blanket leads to a long-lost treasure that once belonged to a powerful but secretive group. Linus must choose between recreating the blanket as a means to regain personal comfort, or relinquishing the information to the secret group to protect them from a potential threat.\n"
"\n"
"Step 7: Climax - Linus makes a decision and faces the consequences\n"
"Ultimately, Linus decides that the greater good is more important than his personal attachment to the blanket. He gives the map to the appropriate people within the secret group, who thank him for his sacrifice. \n"
"\n"
"Step 8: Resolution - Linus learns to cope without the blanket\n"
"Linus continues attending therapy sessions and weaving classes, finding new ways to manage his anxiety. With the support of Emily and the confidence gained from his journey, Linus begins to live a fulfilling life without depending on the security of his childhood blanket.\n"
"\n"
"The Unraveling Thread is a heartfelt story about embracing change, personal growth, and overcoming emotional attachments and fears. Linus' journey is an inspiring tale of bravery and sacrifice, demonstrating the importance of self-discovery and the power of friendship."

"In the movie Counter-Attack, it is the Soviets who launch the offensive by sending a small paratrooper unit led by Colonel Semenov behind enemy lines. Their main objective is to attack a German divisional headquarters, capture an officer for interrogation, and gather intelligence on the Germans' plan for their major attack on the Eastern Front. This offensive is essential to the overall plot, as it fuels the tension and conflict between the characters throughout the film.\n"
"\n"
"Contributing to the intrigue and suspense in the story is the construction of an underwater bridge by the Soviets, intended to conceal their movement and preparations from the Germans. Meanwhile, the Germans are amassing forces in the same sector, suggesting an imminent face-off between the two sides. The film's title, \"Counter-Attack,\" implies that the plot revolves around the theme of strategic maneuvers and actions undertaken by both parties in response to the actions and advances of their adversaries.\n"
"\n"
"The movie features an interesting blend of characters, including a resourceful paratrooper named Alexei Kulkov and Lisa Elenko, a local partisan guide. Their efforts, combined with the help of other characters like the partisans led by Kostyuk, make for an engaging and thrilling story. As Kulkov's mission progresses and he gets trapped with the captured German soldiers, the plot thickens, and the audience is left to wonder who among them is the elusive disguised officer.\n"

"Title: Exploding Targets: A Growing Danger That Can't Be Ignored\n"
"\n"
"In recent times, the alarming proliferation of videos showcasing \"exploding targets\" has raised concerns among federal agencies, lawmakers, and public safety experts. As these products gain popularity, many are calling for stricter regulations to curb their potentially disastrous impacts on the environment and human safety. \n"
"\n"
"Exploding targets, also known as binary exploding targets, are a type of shot indicator widely-used in recreational shooting sessions. They consist of two separate compounds that, when mixed and hit by a projectile such as a bullet, produce a powerful explosion accompanied by a loud bang and a burst of smoke. Sold under various brand names, these targets often imply an added excitement factor for firearm enthusiasts.\n"
"\n"
"The problem, however, lies in the neglectful manner in which these targets are being used, as evidenced by the numerous videos on platforms like YouTube. Users in the videos are often seen blatantly disregarding safety guidelines provided by the manufacturers, leading to dangerous consequences. This behavior has also resulted in an increase in the number of wildfires in recent years - a fact highlighted by the U.S. Forest Service, which has attributed 16 wildfires to the misuse of exploding targets.\n"
"\n"
"Recognizing the potential hazards of these targets, the state of Maryland has taken the first steps towards regulating their use. The move has been seen as a precursor to other states following suit, given the growing awareness surrounding the issues associated with exploding targets. With a stronger regulatory framework in place, it is hoped that the misuse of such products would be mitigated substantially, thereby minimizing the risks to both people and the environment.\n"
"\n"
"In addition to the regulations enacted by individual states, further actions like public awareness campaigns, stronger manufacturer guidelines, and educational initiatives should be employed to tackle this issue comprehensively. Bringing together various stakeholders, including federal and state agencies, manufacturers, and firearm users, would create a more effective response to the dangers posed by exploding targets.\n"
"\n"
"The misuse of exploding targets demands attention, not just from those who enjoy recreational shooting, but also from the broader public. The potential risks of using these products irresponsibly are too grave to ignore. As the Maryland case has shown, regulatory measures can be a positive step in controlling the hazards associated with these targets. However, it is crucial that other states join the movement to create a robust regulatory environment that ensures the safety of both people and the environment.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the rising popularity of exploding targets has brought with it a host of dangers that urgently need to be addressed by regulators, manufacturers, and users alike. While the onus is on individuals to follow safety guidelines, governments must also put in place comprehensive measures to control the risks associated with these devices fully. By working together, it is possible to strike a balance between the enjoyment of recreational shooting and preserving the safety of our communities and the environment."

"Potty-Training Your Toddler: Is There a Right Way?\n"
"When it comes to potty-training, parents' methods vary greatly. Some take a regimented, reward-and-punishment approach, while others ease into it by encouraging poop talk. Is any one way better than the next?\n"
"\n"
"Sorry, parents, there is surprisingly little evidence on the effectiveness of toilet training techniques, reports Dr. Darcie Kiddoo, a professor in the divisions of pediatric surgery and urology at the University of Alberta.\n"
"\n"
"In her brief review of the available literature, published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, Kiddoo highlighted two main philosophies in potty-training technique: one, which was first introduced by pediatrician Dr. T. Berry Brazelton in 1962 — and later promoted by Dr. Spock — is child-oriented. Once children are mentally and physically ready to exert bladder and bowel control, and show interest in doing so, parents are encouraged to let the process unravel in an unregimented and child-focused way, generally using coaxing, repetition and encouragement, while avoiding absolute rules that could result in behavioral problems. In a group of 1,170 children who started potty-training this way at 18 months, Kiddoo reports, daytime continence was achieved by 28.5 months on average.\n"
"\n"
"In 1973, Dr. Nathan Azrin and Dr. Richard Foxx prescribed a contrasting, parent-focused technique. The doctors also recommended beginning only when the child was psychologically and physiologically ready, then using a regimented, four-step process that includes a strategic increase of fluids, a bathroom schedule, positive reinforcement and strong correction of accidents. Two small studies using this method, of 34 and 49 children, respectively, suggested that the average time until continence was just 4.5 hours.\n"
"\n"
"(Other methods noted by Kiddoo involve potty-training infants by holding them over the toilet after meals and \"making a noise that is linked to elimination\"; using rewards like affection and candy when kids stay dry, and using punishment or lack of positive attention when kids have accidents; or attaching daytime wetting alarms to diapers, which ring when wet and signal that it's time for the potty. None have been adequately scientifically studied.)\n"
"\n"
"Based on her review, Kiddoo concluded that there really isn't enough evidence to recommend one training philosophy over another. There is some data to suggest, however, that higher rates of incontinence and urinary tract infections in children may be associated with reward-and-punishment techniques or with later potty training.\n"
"\n"
"Despite the lack of hard evidence, pediatricians groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS), recommend that parents use a child-centric approach, planning to get started at about 18 months of age, only if the child shows interest in toilet training.\n"
"\n"
"Kiddoo offered some advice for parents who are anxious about their child's bathroom behavior:\n"

"Robert Lee \"Bullet Bob\" Hayes (December 20, 1942 - September 18, 2002) was an Olympic sprinter turned American football wide receiver in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys. An American track and field athlete, he was a two-sport stand-out in college in both track and football at Florida A&M University. He has one of the top 100 meter times by NFL players. Hayes was enshrined in the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor in 2001 and was selected for induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in January 2009.\n"
"\n"
"At the 1964 Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, Hayes had his finest hour as a sprinter. First, he won the 100m and in doing so tied the then world record in the 100 m with a time of 10.06 seconds, even though he was running in lane 1 which had, the day before, been used for the 20 km racewalk and this badly chewed up the cinder track. He also was running in borrowed spikes because one of his shoes had been kicked under the bed when he was playing with some friends and he didn't realize until he got there. This was followed by a second gold medal in the 4x100 meter relay, which also produced a new World Record (39.06 seconds).  His come-from-behind win for the US team in the relay was one of the most memorable Olympic moments. Hand-timed between 8.5 and 8.9 seconds, his relay leg is the fastest in history. Jocelyn Delecour, France's anchor leg runner, famously said to Paul Drayton before the relay final that, \"You can't win, all you have is Bob Hayes.\" Drayton was able to reply afterwards, \"That's all we need.\" The race was also Hayes' last as a track and field athlete, as he permanently switched to football after it, aged only 21.  In some of the first meets to be timed with experimental fully automatic timing, Hayes was the first man to break ten seconds for the 100 meters, albeit with a 5.3 m/s wind assistance in the semi-finals of the 1964 Olympics. His time was recorded at 9.91 seconds. Jim Hines officially broke 10 seconds at the high altitude of Mexico City, Mexico in 1968 (and on a synthetic track) with a wind legal 9.95 which stood as the world record for almost 15 years. The next to surpass Hayes at a low altitude Olympics was Carl Lewis in 1984 when he won in 9.99, some 20 years later (though Hasely Crawford equaled the time in 1976).  Until the Tokyo Olympics, world records were measured by officials with stopwatches, measured to the nearest tenth of a second. Although fully automatic timing was used in Tokyo, the times were given the appearance of manual timing. This was done by subtracting 0.05 seconds from the automatic time and rounding to the nearest tenth of a second, making Hayes' time of 10.06 seconds convert to 10.0 seconds, despite the fact that the officials with stopwatches had measured Hayes' time to be 9.9 seconds, and the average difference between manual and automatic times was typically 0.15 to 0.20 seconds. This unique method of determining the official time therefore denied Hayes the record of being the first to officially record 9.9 seconds for the 100 meters. The first official times of 9.9 seconds were recorded at the \"Night of Speed\" in 1968.\n"

"[Answer]First find the difference in hourly wages: $40 / hour - $30 / hour = $10 / hour. Then multiply that difference by the number of hours she works in a week to find the weekly difference: $10 / hour * 40 hours / week = $400 / week. Then multiply that amount by the number of weeks in a month to find the monthly difference in her earnings: $400 / week * 4 weeks / month = $1600 / month. Then find the total additional amount Janet pays in FICA taxes: $25 / week * 4 weeks / month = $100 / month. Then subtract Janet's extra FICA taxes and healthcare premium from the additional money she earns to find the net increase in her pay from freelancing: $1600 / month - $400 / month - $100 / month = $1100 / month.

"A: If Jemma sold 400 glasses frames at $5 each, she made 400 * $5 = $2000. Jemma sold twice as many frames as Dorothy, meaning Dorothy sold 400 / 2 = 200 frames. If Dorothy sold her glasses frames at half the price that Jemma sold hers, then it means she sold her glasses frames at $5 / 2 = $2.5 per glasses frame.

"Title: Gabonese Opposition Parties Boycott Election of New National Assembly Speaker\n"
"\n"
"In a recent political development in Gabon, opposition parties have decided to boycott the election of a new speaker for the National Assembly, raising concerns on the political stability and future course of the nation. This decision of non-participation by opposition members aims to express their dissatisfaction and disapproval of the electoral process, which they believe to be biased and unjust.\n"
"\n"
"The opposition parties argue that the ruling party, the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG), is attempting to limit the role of opposing factions in the legislative process, undermining the democratic principles that should guide all political activities in the country. Allegations of vote manipulation, unfair campaign practices, and favoritism toward the PDG have significantly increased tensions between the ruling party and its critics, culminating in the boycott of the speaker's election.\n"
"\n"
"As per the constitution, the National Assembly Speaker holds considerable influence and responsibility in the legislative proceedings, such as setting the agenda, moderating debates, and deciding on crucial procedural questions. Boycotting the election is a powerful symbol of disapproval, as it reflects the opposition's lack of faith both in the electoral process and in the country's governance.\n"
"\n"
"While the Gabonese opposition has not given much hope for a reconciliation between the parties or outlined a clear course of action beyond the boycott, it has urged for increased international scrutiny and monitoring of all electoral proceedings. It is believed that this could help in deterring fraudulent practices and restoring public confidence in the democratic processes of Gabon.\n"
"\n"
"In response to the boycott, the Gabonese government led by President Ali Bongo Ondimba has reiterated its commitment to free and fair elections, dismissing the allegations of unfairness and bias. However, this has not convinced the opposition parties, who claim that the National Assembly's composition does not accurately represent the electorate's will, thereby making the legislative body illegitimate and unrepresentative.\n"
"\n"
"The political crisis in Gabon sparks concern among regional and international players for several reasons. Gabon is one of the largest oil producers in the sub-Saharan Africa, making it an essential market player in global energy. Additionally, the nation holds a strategic geopolitical position in Central Africa, which makes it an influential force in the African Union. Thus, any political unrest within the country could have wider implications both economically and diplomatically.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the boycott of the National Assembly Speaker's election by the Gabonese opposition signifies a deeply rooted distrust in the political system and an urgent need for reform. International observers and diplomatic partners must engage with Gabon's political leadership to help address these grievances and restore stability in the country. Without constructive dialogue and credible actions towards greater transparency and inclusiveness, Gabon's political tensions will continue to escalate, potentially leading to severe consequences for the nation and the region."

"(I). Benjamin did not know any people there.\n"
"\n"
"Though Benjamin was generally quite sociable, he found himself rather uneasy and out of his comfort zone this particular evening. He hadn't known that Donald, his roommate and close friend, had managed to encircle himself with such a diverse and eclectic group of intriguing individuals. A keen observer of human nature, this party was the perfect place for Benjamin to put his observational skills to the test.\n"
"\n"
"Upon entering the grand, high-ceilinged party hall, Benjamin felt the palpable shift from his everyday life into this world that was so clearly Donald's domain. Resplendent chandeliers cast a warm, inviting glow upon the guests, whose appearances ranged from the impeccably dressed to the fantastically bohemian. Conversations varying from philosophy and poetry to business strategies buzzed in different corners of the grand hall. However, Benjamin's lack of acquaintance made him feel alien in this elaborate tableau.\n"
"\n"
"Sticking close to Donald, Benjamin moved through the sea of strangers, attempting to acclimate to this hitherto unknown realm. Donald, comfortable in his element, flowed from group to group like a seasoned diplomat, enthralling his audience irrespective of the topic. Left to his own devices, Benjamin found himself at a loss, only picking up fragments of discussions from the party’s many clusters of conversation.\n"
"\n"
"Realizing he needed to take some initiative, Benjamin adopted the role of an eager listener. He started shadowing Donald not just physically but conversationally too. He would keep an ear out for engaging topics and tried to subtly contribute when he could. He read about most subjects, be it politics, literature, sports or pop-culture and used it to his advantage. Soon, he could sense a drop in his anxiety as he realised that he was quite capable of holding complex conversations with people much more experienced and exposure-wise potent than him.\n"
"\n"
"As the evening passed, Benjamin discovered more layers to Donald's life that he was clueless about. He was amazed to uncover facets of their friendship that spanned more than their shared apartment. Donald's rich and varied interests, represented by the party's eclectic group, challenged Benjamin in a way he hadn't anticipated. While Donald had a novel ready to narrate about seemingly every individual present, he seemed to carry an affectionate patience for Benjamin's more reserved nature.\n"
"\n"
"Slowly, with Donald’s help and his own efforts, Benjamin started to feel more at ease. He found some common ground with a group of foreign film enthusiasts, and before he knew it, he was partaking in an animated discussion about international cinema. The initial unease gradually gave way to a buzzing energy, as Benjamin found himself amongst new friends with shared interests.\n"
"\n"
"In retrospect, Benjamin realized that sticking to Donald was a lifeline at the beginning of the party, but by the end of the night, he found himself navigated through the party’s uncharted territory. The party turned out to be a night of unexpected evolution for Benjamin, shifting from an outsider to an active participant in the melting pot of discussions, marking his first successful voyage into Donald’s diverse world of connections."

"How might one describe the sentiment of this review?\n"
"Would be at least 4 stars but let me explain the reasoning behind my review of 1 star.  I discovered Tracy Rigg via Yelp where a fellow Elite rated her services as 5 stars while I was on a hunt for a natural stylist in Charlotte to prevent from my constant travels back home to Chicago to get my hair done. I made an appointment to see Tracy while she was in the SouthPark location and was pleased with my cut and the product not too much the style as it made me look like a old women with the extreme layers. After I wrapped it and slept on it it fell like I would've liked it to so I LOVED the results as they were due to the products which I purchased (No Parabens - Tracy products) and her process of getting my natural hair straightened for the first time since I went natural.  Tracy schedule is pretty tight and after having that personal appointment in an one on one setting was SOLD and expressed my desire to have her as my hair stylist in Charlotte for my straightening twice a year.  Let's get to this 1 STAR review: Last year December my daughter and I were heading home for our annual Nutcracker ballet show and I tried scheduling with Tracy as early as October and was unsuccessful as the site is very deceiving as it allow you to choose Tracy and see her schedule and even choose a time however when you click SCHEDULE you get an error that states \"Tracy Riggs requires you to call in to schedule\" which I did and left a message and didn't get a call back after 5 days so I emailed and got a response that the days that I saw were available are no longer available and since our flights were booked we had no alternative dates and time so she suggested her new stylist from our hometown of Chicago (Kim) and we accepted.  NOTE: This was her way of not accepting us as a client   Kim did a great job however it was EXTREMELY overpriced we paid $180 for two wash and blowouts, needless to say we didn't go back afterwards.  FastForward to this week: I'm having a baby in a couple days and already haver plans for Christmas so again I tried to schedule an appointment with Tracy online and got the same error I mentioned earlier so again I called and never received a call back. Three days later I called again and mentioned my message I left and my issue scheduling, this time I was told FLAT OUT \" Tracy isn't accepting clients she only accept appointments for regulars\". My issue with this is  1. The website is deceiving where it allow you to see all the availability of Tracy where her schedule has space 2. How can you become a regular if you are NEVER able to schedule? 3. The unprofessionalism when a potential client leaves a message with contact info and no one returns the call or try to return the call.  Needless to say, I will not be trying this place again. The new location is nice as I visited last year and uploaded a photo BUT that's it that's all. I'll stick to driving to ATL to Loop Salon or flying home to Chicago to get my hair done by professionals who schedules are clear and they don't discriminate against new clients or toward those clients who only want to come twice a year to avoid heat damage to natural hair....OPT:\n"

"Jonas Edward Salk (; October 28, 1914 - June 23, 1995) was an American medical researcher and virologist. He discovered and developed one of the first successful polio vaccines. Born in New York City, he attended New York University School of Medicine, later choosing to do medical research instead of becoming a practicing physician. In 1939, after earning his medical degree, Salk began an internship as a physician scientist at Mount Sinai Hospital.\n"
"\n"
"In 1966, The New York Times referred to him as the \"Father of Biophilosophy.\" According to Times journalist and author Howard Taubman, \"he never forgets... there is a vast amount of darkness for man to penetrate. As a biologist, he believes that his science is on the frontier of tremendous new discoveries; and as a philosopher, he is convinced that humanists and artists have joined the scientists to achieve an understanding of man in all his physical, mental and spiritual complexity. Such interchanges might lead, he would hope, to a new and important school of thinkers he would designate as biophilosophers.\" Salk told his cousin, Joel Kassiday, at a meeting of the Congressional Clearinghouse on the Future on Capitol Hill in 1984 that he was optimistic that ways to prevent most human and animal diseases would eventually be developed. Salk said people must be prepared to take prudent risks, since \"a risk-free society would become a dead-end society\" without progress.  Salk describes his \"biophilosophy\" as the application of a \"biological, evolutionary point of view to philosophical, cultural, social and psychological problems.\" He went into more detail in two of his books, Man's Unfolding, and The Survival of the Wisest. In an interview in 1980, he described his thoughts on the subject, including his feeling that a sharp rise and an expected leveling off in the human population would take place and eventually bring a change in human attitudes:  \"I think of biological knowledge as providing useful analogies for understanding human nature.... People think of biology in terms of such practical matters as drugs, but its contribution to knowledge about living systems and ourselves will in the future be equally important.... In the past epoch, man was concerned with death, high mortality; his attitudes were antideath, antidisease\", he says. \"In the future, his attitudes will be expressed in terms of prolife and prohealth. The past was dominated by death control; in the future, birth control will be more important. These changes we're observing are part of a natural order and to be expected from our capacity to adapt. It's much more important to cooperate and collaborate. We are the co-authors with nature of our destiny.\"  His definition of a \"biophilosopher\" is \"Someone who draws upon the scriptures of nature, recognizing that we are the product of the process of evolution, and understands that we have become the process itself, through the emergence and evolution of our consciousness, our awareness, our capacity to imagine and anticipate the future, and to choose from among alternatives.\"  Just prior to his death, Salk was working on a new book along the theme of biophilosophy, privately reported to be titled Millennium of the Mind.\n"

"The first step in the process of a bird's life cycle begins with the formation of an egg. This step involves a series of intricate biological processes that lay the foundation for the genesis of a new life. To understand this initial stage better, let's dive deeper into the various sub-steps and aspects involved in the formation of a bird's egg.\n"
"\n"
"1. Hormonal stimulation: The bird's reproductive system is activated due to hormonal changes triggered by external factors such as daylight, weather, or food availability. The hormones involved include gonadotropins, produced by the pituitary gland, and sex hormones like estrogen and progesterone, secreted by the reproductive organs (ovaries in females and testes in males).\n"
"\n"
"2. Follicle development: As a result of hormonal stimulation, the ovarian follicles found within the female bird's ovaries begin to mature. Each follicle contains a germ cell, which will eventually develop into an ovum (egg cell).\n"
"\n"
"3. Ovum development: The germ cells within the follicles develop into ova, triggered by the released hormones. Once an ovum is fully matured, it detaches itself from the follicle wall. This ovum carries half of the genetic material required to make a complete individual.\n"
"\n"
"4. Yolk formation: Simultaneously, nutrients such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and vitamins are accumulated within the ovum. This will form the yolk, which serves as the main source of nourishment for the embryo once fertilization occurs.\n"
"\n"
"5. Ovulation: Upon full maturation, ovulation follows, where the ovum is released from the ovary into the oviduct (a series of tubes connecting to the uterus). Ovulation in birds typically occurs 2-4 hours before the process of laying an egg begins.\n"
"\n"
"6. Fertilization: If a female bird has mated, sperm from the male bird travels up the oviduct to fertilize the ovum, combining the genetic material of both parents to create a new individual. The fertilized ovum then transforms into a zygote.\n"
"\n"
"7. Albumen Secretion: As the zygote moves down the oviduct, layers of a protein-rich fluid called albumen are deposited around it. The albumen serves as a shock-absorber and a water source, protecting the embryo during incubation.\n"
"\n"
"8. Shell membrane formation: Next, the shell membranes are formed around the albumen. These membranes are crucial for holding the contents of the egg intact while facilitating gas exchange between the developing embryo and its environment.\n"
"\n"
"9. Shell Formation: The final sub-step involves the calcification of the eggshell in the uterus, utilizing calcium stored in the bird's body. The hard yet porous shell protects the egg contents while still permitting air and moisture exchange.\n"
"\n"
"10. Egg-laying: The fully formed egg is then laid by the female bird and incubation begins, either by the mother or both parents, depending on the bird species. Incubation is vital for maintaining the proper temperature and humidity required for the embryo's growth and development.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the first step in the process of a bird's life cycle is the formation of an egg, which involves a series of intricate biological events initiated by hormonal stimulation and culminating in the laying of a fully-formed egg, ready for incubation and hatching into a baby bird."

"Title: Democrat Surges in Poll Ahead of N.Y. Special Election\n"
"\n"
"[Step 1: Start with a brief introduction to the article topic]\n"
"In a dramatic turn of events, the Democratic candidate for the upcoming special election in New York has made significant progress in the polls, pulling ahead of their rival in a contest that was once seen as a tight race.\n"
"\n"
"[Step 2: Explain the background/context of the special election]\n"
"The special election, scheduled for November 3, 2021, was called to fill the vacant seat in New York's 4th Congressional District left by the resignation of the former representative earlier this year. The high-stakes race has attracted national attention and turned into a battleground for both parties, as it may have far-reaching impacts on the political landscape.\n"
"\n"
"[Step 3: Present data and figures to support the claim in the title]\n"
"According to the latest poll conducted by XYZ Research Institute, the Democratic candidate, John Doe, has experienced a surge in support, leading the Republican candidate, Jane Smith, by 6 points, 48% to 42%. This marks a significant change from just two weeks ago when the two candidates were neck-and-neck in the polls, indicating a potential shift in voter sentiment.\n"
"\n"
"[Step 4: Provide possible reasons for the surge in the Democratic candidate's poll numbers]\n"
"There are several factors that may have contributed to this upward trend in the Democratic candidate's poll numbers. First, John Doe received a series of high-profile endorsements from key political figures, helping boost his credibility among undecided voters. Secondly, the recent debates proved advantageous for the Democratic campaign, as John Doe was able to articulate clear policy plans, particularly on issues of healthcare and education, which resonated with voters in the district.\n"
"\n"
"[Step 5: Mention the Republican candidate's reaction to the updated poll results]\n"
"In response to the new poll results, Jane Smith, the Republican candidate, has doubled down on her campaign efforts, focusing on a platform centered around economic recovery and job creation in the district. Her campaign has also initiated a series of attack ads aimed at questioning John Doe's qualifications and commitment to the district.\n"
"\n"
"[Step 6: Address the uncertainty and potential future developments in the race]\n"
"While the latest poll numbers indicate a shift in favor of the Democratic candidate, the race remains tight and uncertain. In this highly polarized political climate, the outcome could be swayed by unforeseen events, such as a late-breaking scandal or a significant national development. Both campaigns will need to continuously adapt to the rapidly changing political landscape in order to secure a victory in the special election.\n"
"\n"
"[Step 7: Conclude the article by reiterating its potential implications]\n"
"The result of the NY-4 special election could have far-reaching consequences for both parties at a national level. A win for the Democrats could provide momentum for their broader political agenda, while a Republican victory would signal strength in traditionally competitive districts. As November 3 approaches, all eyes will be on New York’s 4th Congressional District to see which party will ultimately prevail in this closely watched race."

"The fruit with varieties called Smooth Cayenne, Red Spanish, and Sugarloaf is the pineapple. Pineapple, scientifically known as Ananas comosus, is a tropical plant with an edible multiple fruit consisting of coalesced berries. It is native to South America, specifically the region that stretches between southern Brazil and Paraguay. Pineapples are now cultivated in various tropical and subtropical regions around the world for their delicious and refreshing fruit, and they play a vital role in global fruit production.\n"
"\n"
"Let's explore each variety in more detail:\n"
"\n"
"1. Smooth Cayenne: This is the most widely grown and well-known variety of pineapple, accounting for about 70% of global pineapple production. The Smooth Cayenne pineapple originates from the Guiana region in South America and was later introduced to Hawaii, where it became the dominant cultivar. This variety is characterized by its cylindrical shape, golden-yellow skin, and a uniform texture of its sweet, mild-flavored flesh. The fruit is both juicy and fibrous, with low acidity, and it is often used for both fresh consumption and canning. The plant has spineless leaves, which makes it easier for growers to handle during cultivation and harvesting.\n"
"\n"
"2. Red Spanish: Also called \"Florida Special\" or \"Kona Sugarloaf\", the Red Spanish pineapple is a popular variety in the Caribbean, Mexico, Florida, and some parts of Central and South America. The fruit has a more compact and round shape compared to Smooth Cayenne, and its skin has a reddish-brown color when ripe. The flesh of the Red Spanish pineapple is pale-yellow, sweet, and aromatic, with a high fiber content and a slightly more acidic taste than the Smooth Cayenne. This variety is particularly suitable for fresh fruit consumption, as its firmer texture makes it less suitable for canning. The plant has spiny, bluish-grey leaves, which distinguishes it from the Smooth Cayenne.\n"
"\n"
"3. Sugarloaf: The Sugarloaf pineapple, also known as \"Pan de Azúcar\" or \"Kaua'i Sugarloaf\", is named after its distinct conical, almost sugarloaf-like shape. This variety is highly regarded for its sweet and juicy white or pale-yellow flesh with low acidity, making it an excellent choice for fresh fruit consumption. The fruit's core is more tender than in other varieties, and many people consider it edible. The skin of the Sugarloaf pineapple is light green, even when ripe, which can make it difficult to determine its optimal ripeness. Sugarloaf pineapples are primarily grown in the Caribbean, Central and South America, and the Hawaiian island of Kauai.\n"
"\n"
"All three varieties of pineapple—Smooth Cayenne, Red Spanish, and Sugarloaf—are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, providing various health benefits. Pineapples contain a unique enzyme called bromelain, which aids digestion, reduces inflammation, and may provide therapeutic effects. Pineapples also offer high amounts of vitamin C, manganese, and dietary fiber, all of which contribute to a well-rounded, nutritious diet. Despite these differences in appearance, taste, and texture, each variety of pineapple is enjoyed worldwide for its unique and delicious flavor profile, making them a popular choice for fresh fruit consumption and use in various dishes and beverages."

"Myth Evermore, and I cannot bear to hide my feelings any longer. It's as if my heart has unlocked a new chamber, one that beats solely for him, and I find myself unable to resist the allure of his charm, intellect, and passion.\" Persia's voice wavers, tinged with a mix of excitement and fear as she bares the truth of her emotions.\n"
"\n"
"Fiend Dalliant's hardened expression softens as he gazes at the vulnerable woman before him. He, too, has known the sweet anguish of love, its heady delights and sting of rejection. Swallowing his pride, he sets aside his personal feelings, realizing that Persia's happiness is of utmost importance. \"I understand, Persia,\" he relents with a sad smile. \"Our connection may have brought us together, but love is not a bond that can be forced or manipulated. If your heart belongs to Myth, then I must accept it and do what I can to support you.\"\n"
"\n"
"A glimmer of appreciation shimmers in Persia's eyes, a tear threatening to spill over. \"Thank you, Fiend. Your understanding and willingness to let me go means more to me than you may ever know.\"\n"
"\n"
"Fiend, his heart heavy, nods as he takes a determined step back. \"All I ask is that you promise me one thing, Persia. Be careful with your newfound love, for it can often be a double-edged sword. Do not lose yourself completely in the dizzying whirlwind of emotions, and always remain the strong, independent woman I know and admire.\"\n"
"\n"
"An earnest smile tugs at the corners of Persia's lips. \"I promise, Fiend. And I hope that, one day, you'll find a love that's as fulfilling as the one blossoming between Myth and me.\"\n"
"\n"
"With that, Persia turns to depart, her footsteps leading her toward the source of her newfound joy and commitment. Though the painful sting of unrequited love lingers in Fiend Dalliant's heart, he knows deep within that he ultimately made the right choice. True love, after all, is about wishing the utmost happiness for the person one cares for, even if it means self-sacrifice and setting them free.\n"
"\n"
"In the days and weeks that follow, Persia's love for Myth Evermore only grows stronger, her heart skipping a beat each time their paths cross. They begin to spend more time together, sharing their interests, beliefs, and dreams for the future. And with every conversation, every stolen glance, and every touch, their connection deepens, entwining their hearts into an unbreakable bond.\n"
"\n"
"And as for Fiend Dalliant, though his heart aches at the thought of Persia in another's arms, he stays true to his promise. Rather than wallowing in despair, he embraces the pain as a reminder, a sign that he is capable of feeling such profound emotions. He moves forward, resolved to discover his own purpose in life and forge new connections beyond the confines of his longing for Persia.\n"
"\n"
"Ultimately, all three undergo a significant journey of self-discovery and growth, their lives forever changed by the lessons that love imparts. For it is in the interplay of love, loss, and acceptance that they each find the path to their destinies and the joy that life has to offer. And though the passage of time may alter their feelings and circumstances, the indelible impact of their shared experiences remains, a testament to the power of love and the choices they dared to make."

"The decision to undergo surgery was made after Anderson consulted with team doctors and specialists and determined that it was the best course of action to ensure a full recovery and return to his previous form.\n"
"\n"
"Step 2: Explain the impact of the surgery on the team\n"
"\n"
"Brett Anderson's absence from the Athletics' pitching rotation due to the surgery will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the team's performance down the stretch. Anderson was considered a cornerstone of the rotation, and his absence leaves a glaring hole that will need to be filled by inexperienced or underperforming pitchers on the roster.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, the prolonged recovery period for Tommy John surgery can be as long as 12-18 months, which means that Anderson may not be available to contribute to the team until late next season, at the earliest.\n"
"\n"
"Step 3: Mention potential replacements for Anderson\n"
"\n"
"While it is impossible to replace a talent like Brett Anderson, the Athletics will need to explore potential roster changes to offset the loss. Some options include internal promotions from their minor league teams, signing available free agents, or exploring trades with other clubs.\n"
"\n"
"Some possible candidates for promotion from within the organization include Jesús Luzardo and Daulton Jefferies, both promising young pitchers who have displayed impressive performances in the minor leagues.\n"
"\n"
"Step 4: Discuss the long-term implications for the Athletics and Anderson\n"
"\n"
"The Tommy John surgery is undoubtedly a significant setback for both the Athletics and Brett Anderson. While there is a high success rate for pitchers returning from the procedure, there are no guarantees, and the long recovery process will be critical for Anderson to regain his former prowess on the mound.\n"
"\n"
"For the Athletics, Anderson's injury serves as a stark reminder of how quickly a team's fortunes can change due to unforeseen circumstances. Moving forward, management must carefully evaluate their roster depth and develop contingency plans to better adapt to such changes and setbacks in the future.\n"
"\n"
"Conclusion:\n"
"\n"
"Despite the surge of adversity, the Oakland Athletics remain optimistic and are committed to overcoming their challenges to field a competitive team. The loss of Brett Anderson to Tommy John surgery is undoubtedly a significant blow, but the organization has weathered such storms before. The true test for the Athletics will be their ability to adapt, learn and grow from this experience, ultimately emerging as a stronger and more resilient team in the face of adversity."

"Title: The Unfortunate Firing of Veteran Journalist Paige Wiser: Juggling Parenthood and Professionalism\n"
"\n"
"Paige Wiser seemed to have it all—a promising journalism career as the Chicago Sun-Times TV critic, spanning over 17 long years, family, and a working-mother's ability to juggle responsibilities both at home and the office. But in a twist of fate, all of that changed when a combination of unfortunate events eventually led to Wiser being fired from her job, and all because of a vomiting child.\n"
"\n"
"It all started when Wiser was assigned to cover the \"Glee Live!\" concert for the newspaper. As any working parent can attest, sometimes personal and professional schedules collide. That Friday night was no different for Wiser, who brought along her two young children to the concert. What she didn't expect, however, was how that decision would snowball into a series of events that would lead to her professional demise.\n"
"\n"
"Only 13 songs into the concert, Wiser's son fell off a chair and her daughter started vomiting into a cotton-candy bag. That was when Wiser was forced to leave the concert to take care of her children, thus missing the encore. Unable to complete the concert review herself, Wiser based her commentary on information gathered from previous shows, an action that eventually had severe repercussions on her career.\n"
"\n"
"Despite her 17-year tenure with the Chicago Sun-Times, Wiser was fired from her position as the paper's TV critic because her \"Glee Live!\" review made references to a song that wasn’t performed during the concert, and another song that Wiser did not actually see. In an act of professionalism, Wiser both explains and apologizes for her actions, as recounted by the Chicago Tribune and Time Out Chicago.\n"
"\n"
"During an interview, Wiser stated that she would like to think that her decision to include the erroneous information about the encore wouldn't have been part of her thought process, had it not been 1 a.m. and her desperation to get the story done. She further explained the difficulties of being a working parent in the journalism industry, saying, \"Trying to do this with the kids and a three-hour commute, and when every editor wants something different, let’s just say it’s become a very strange place. And because there’s not a lot of people with kids at the paper, I’m a little sensitive about coming across like I can’t do it because of my kids.”\n"
"\n"
"The incident brought a tremendous amount of attention, with Gawker taking the opportunity to make light of the situation. But beneath the surface lies an often overlooked struggle that many working parents face when trying to find the balance between their careers and family responsibilities. Unfortunately for Wiser, her delicate balancing act eventually tipped the scales, with her career paying the ultimate price.\n"
"\n"
"The case of Paige Wiser serves as a stark reminder for many working parents that the struggle to find the perfect balance between professionalism and parenthood is indeed real, and sometimes, when things go wrong, the consequences can be dire. Regardless of the outcome, Wiser has shown an undeniable sense of integrity and accountability, and her journey will surely resonate with parents who face their own battles in striking the right balance."

"(1) Carrie has a small waistline.\n"
"\n"
"Carrie and Rebecca had been best friends since high school. They had always been inseparable, sharing secrets and dreams while roaming through the halls of the school. One thing that set them apart, however, was their relationship with sweets.\n"
"\n"
"Carrie had always struggled with her sweet tooth. Desserts, chocolate, and candy had always been her weakness, and she just couldn't resist indulging herself whenever she got the chance. Despite her love for sweets, she had managed to maintain a small waistline, thanks to her strict workout routine and healthy diet. Carrie had mastered the art of maintaining the perfect balance between treating herself to sweet indulgences now and then without damaging her figure.\n"
"\n"
"Rebecca, on the other hand, never really had an issue with sweet treats. She preferred the taste of savory and spicy dishes, and her snacks of choice were usually chips and dips. Rebecca was quite content with an occasional dessert during celebrations, but she rarely craved sweet delights. Like her friend, she had always been conscious about her diet, but it seemed to come naturally to her since she didn't have the same penchant for sweets as Carrie did.\n"
"\n"
"As the years passed, Carrie and Rebecca found themselves attending college on opposite sides of the country. They remained best friends, continuously chatting over the phone and sharing stories about their new lives. Carrie had confided in Rebecca that she was struggling to maintain her small waistline while being away from home. The stress of college caused her cravings for sweets to increase, but she didn't have the same motivation or access to her usual workout routine.\n"
"\n"
"Understanding her friend's predicament, Rebecca offered to help Carrie develop some new strategies to cope with her cravings and stressful situations. They devised a plan to avoid high-calorie sweets, as well as setting daily goals for exercise and healthy eating. Their shared mission strengthened their bond as they supported and encouraged each other in their efforts to maintain their slim figures in the face of temptation.\n"
"\n"
"As Carrie began to adjust to her new lifestyle, she found that her cravings were less intense, and she was learning to recognize and respond to her body's cues more effectively. Rebecca was proud of her friend for taking control of her cravings and developing a healthier attitude towards sweets. Meanwhile, she continued to enjoy her savory treats, knowing that she had Carrie's support in staying conscious of her diet.\n"
"\n"
"Carrie and Rebecca proved that maintaining a small waistline was achievable, even with the challenges they both faced. Their commitment to their health and fitness, along with their strong friendship, enabled them to conquer their cravings, manage their stress and maintain their enviable figures.\n"
"\n"
"Throughout their lives, Carrie and Rebecca never let their differences get in the way of their friendship. Their ability to understand and support each other's unique struggles is a testament to the depth of connection and mutual respect they shared. Through thick and thin, they continued to inspire and encourage one another, proving that with dedication and friendship, even the most challenging obstacles can be overcome."

This movie is badly done, the visuals in this movie are not inspiring, the dialog is worse, the musical numbers destroy this movie.. I chuckled for GUITAR BROTHERS, but that was immediately wiped out by something completely unnecessary, and irrelevant. It attempted to be deep and meaningful I think, but its just pretentious disoriented nonsense. Freshman film students without a camera could craft something more interesting.\n"
"\n"
"Guitar Brothers and the stand up routines in between skits get 1 point each, everything else is just badly paced, pseudo-creative, heavy handed attempts at being AS good as films by other REAL directors like, Sogo Ishii, David Lynch, and Jodoworsky. Give me a break. I am convinced that people that rave about FFFC are doing so because they have no idea of what they saw, because it was nothing but mild pertinent statements here and there mixed with stupidity and blended until you puke on your own shoes.\n"
"\n"
"This movie was an extreme disappointment, coming off the high that was Survive Style 5+, a film that actually has meaning, combined with excellent use of scenery, cinematography, catchy dialog, funny moments, good soundtrack, excellent performances, fantastic pacing and flow. FFFC features the exact opposite in every way, boring scenery (20 minutes staring at a bland beach at night? a completely white stage? Alien balls floating in white space? a dinky school hallway and then a... school hallway?), terrible cinematography, forgettable dialog, nothing funny or humorous, save the fact you just wasted your life for two hours, soundtrack?, amateurish performances, uneven, disjointed, and often flat out dragging pacing, zero flow whatsoever.\n"
"\n"
"There are those that claim this is what makes FFFC a great movie, that it is so unconventional at every turn that its pure genius. This is simply a way to stroke your own ego it seems, because \"unpredictable\" could be a good quality for a film if it wasn't coupled with \"boring\", \"innane\", and \"terrible\". Personally I have spoken with two people who admitted to me that FFFC was terrible when they left the theater, but overwhelming rave by art-house elitist made them watch the movie again and then come back to me with a... \"Hey it was pretty good I liked it\".\n"
"\n"
"I'm going to put my foot down, this movie is slop, I don't care if Roger Ebert says this film is the best thing he's ever watched since he lost his own virginity. \"The Emperor's new cloak\" I say... this movie is no way indicative of the other psychedelic/trippy films to come from Japan in the last 10 years. Taste of Tea, Party 7, and Kamikaze Girls are much better movies (even with a low budget), and none can honestly compare with Survive Style 5+. Watch FFFC only if your interested in making a pretentious pile of nothing on a shoestring budget.\n"

"Q: Michael and Thomas are selling their lego collections. They agree to split any money they earn. They sell them based on how many circles are on top. Each circle costs 1 cent. They earned $5 each after selling 100 single pieces, 45 double pieces, 50 triple pieces and a number of quadruple pieces. How many quadruple pieces did they sell?\n"
"A: They made $10 because 2 x 5 = 10. They made $1 off single pieces because 100 x .01 = 1. They made $.9 off double pieces because 45 x .02 = .9. They made $1.5 off triple pieces because 50 x .03 = 1.5. They earned $3.4 off the first three types because 1 + .9 + 1.5 = 3.4. They earned $6.6 off the quadruple pieces because 10 - 3.4 = 6.6. They sold 165 quadruple pieces because 6.6 / .04 = 165. The answer is 165.\n"

"[Answer]If Carla sampled 5 cupcakes from each batch and fed them to her dogs, each batch had 65 - 5 = 60 cupcakes afterwards. Since Carla made 45 batches of cupcakes for her daughter's birthday party, after removing the 5 cupcakes from each batch, Carla's daughter and her friends received 45 * 60 = 2700 cupcakes. The total number of people at the party is 19 friends + 1 daughter = 20. After sharing the cupcakes equally among them, Carla's daughter and her friends each received 2700 / 20 = 135 cupcakes.

If 40% of gnomes in the Ravenswood forest are taken for use by the owner of the forest, the number of gnomes will reduce by 40 / 100 * 80 = 32. The number of gnomes that will remain is 80 - 32 = 48.

"Jack William Nicklaus (born January 21, 1940), nicknamed The Golden Bear, is an American retired professional golfer. He is widely regarded as the greatest golfer of all time, winning a record 18 career major championships, while producing 19 second-place and 9 third-place finishes, over a span of 25 years. Nicklaus focused on the major championships--Masters Tournament, U.S. Open, Open Championship and PGA Championship--and played a selective schedule of regular PGA Tour events, yet still finished with 73 victories, third on the all-time list behind Sam Snead (82) and Tiger Woods (79).\n"
"\n"
"In 1980, Nicklaus recorded only four top-10 finishes in 14 events, but two of these were record-setting victories in majors (the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship); the other two were a tie for fourth in The Open Championship and a runner-up finish in the Doral-Eastern Open to Raymond Floyd via his chip-in birdie on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff. These victories and placements more than justified the work Nicklaus put in toward his game during the off-season.  Nicklaus set a new scoring record for the 1980 U.S. Open with an aggregate of 272, eclipsing his earlier record of 275 from 1967 over the same golf course. That record, while since having been tied by three other players, stood until Rory McIlroy's 268 in winning the 2011 US Open. This was Nicklaus's second major win at Baltusrol Golf Club. Nicklaus opened with a record-tying 63 in round one and fought off his playing partner of all four rounds, 1978 Colgate World Match Play Championship winner, Isao Aoki. Entering the final round, Aoki had caught Nicklaus after three consecutive rounds of 68, but over the course of the last day, Nicklaus pulled away by two shots. Each player birdied the final two holes for a dramatic finish. Aoki's aggregate of 274 was the lowest score for a U.S. Open runner-up. Nicklaus' win was his fourth and final victory in the championship, tying him with Willie Anderson, Bobby Jones, and Ben Hogan. Nicklaus referred to this win as \"by far the most emotional and warmest reaction to any of my wins in my own country\".  In the 1980 PGA Championship, Nicklaus set another record in winning the championship by seven shots over Andy Bean at the Oak Hill Country Club, largely due to exceptional putting. Nicklaus shot an even-par 70 in the first round followed by three successive rounds in the 60s over the difficult course, and was the only player to break par for the 72 holes. For the week, the field averaged 74.60 strokes while Nicklaus averaged 68.50. This was Nicklaus' fifth and final victory in the PGA Championship, which elevated him to record-holder for the most wins in the stroke-play era, and which tied him with Walter Hagen for the most wins overall, since Hagen's victories were all during the match-play era. Nicklaus' seven-shot winning margin remained the largest for the stroke-play version of the championship until Rory's McIroy's 2012 victory. This victory also made Nicklaus the only player since Gene Sarazen in 1922 and Ben Hogan in 1948 to win the U.S. Open and PGA Championship the same year (subsequently equaled by Tiger Woods in 2000).\n"

"A: The price $7500 is 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price. So, every 1% is equal to $7500 / 75% = $100. Hence, the original price is equal to $100 / 1% x 100% = $10000. The answer is 10000.\n"
"Question: To raise funds for her local soup kitchen, Didi enlisted the help of her family, friends, and neighbors. They donated 10 same-size cakes that she sliced into 8 slices per cake and started selling a slice for $1. A local business owner was so impressed by Didi's efforts that she offered to donate 50 cents for each slice Didi sold. A second business owner also offered to donate a quarter for each slice sold. If Didi sold all the slices, how much money did she raise?\n"
"Answer: All the cakes yielded 10 * 8 = 80 slices. Since Didi was selling each slice for $1, it means she sold everything for 80 * 1 = 80 dollars. The first business owner donated 50 / 100 * 80 = 40 dollars. The second business owner donated 25 / 100 * 80 = 20 dollars. Adding both amounts gives 80 + 40 + 20 = 140 dollars. The answer is 140.\n"

Miley needed to get some for her party, and she decided to buy 5 packs of swiss cheese, 600 grams of blue cheese, and one-third less white cheese. How much did she need to pay for all the cheese?\n"
"[Answer]For the swiss cheese, Miley paid 5 * 6 = $30. 600 grams of blue cheese means 600 / 200 = 3 packages. So for the blue cheese, Miley paid 3 * 8 = $24. One - third of the blue cheese means 1 / 3 * 600 = 200 grams. So Miley bought only 600 - 200 = 400 grams of white cheese. Which means 400 / 200 = 2 packages. So for the white cheese, Miley paid 2 * 5 = $10. So in total for all the cheese, Miley paid 30 + 24 + 10 = $64. The answer is 64.\n"

"Information:  - Charles Edward Anderson \"Chuck\" Berry (born October 18, 1926) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter and is one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. With songs such as \"Maybellene\" (1955), \"Roll Over Beethoven\" (1956), \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1957) and \"Johnny B. Goode\" (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music.  - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.  - \"Roll Over Beethoven\" is a 1956 hit single by Chuck Berry, originally released on Chess Records, with \"Drifting Heart\" as the B-side. The lyrics of the song mention rock and roll and the desire for rhythm and blues to replace classical music. The title of the song is an imperative directed at the composer Ludwig van Beethoven to roll over in his grave in reaction to the new genre of music that Berry was promoting. The song has been covered by many other artists, including the Beatles and the Electric Light Orchestra. \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked it number 97 on its list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".  - `` Around and Around '' is a 1958 rock song written and first recorded by Chuck Berry . It originally appeared under the name `` Around & Around '' as the B - side to the single `` Johnny B. Goode '' .  - \"Maybellene\" is one of the first rock-and-roll songs. It was written and recorded in 1955 by Chuck Berry, and inspired/adapted from the Western Swing fiddle tune \"Ida Red,\" which was recorded in 1938 by Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys. Berry's song tells the story of a hot rod race and a broken romance. It was released in July 1955 as a single by Chess Records, of Chicago, Illinois. It was Berry's first single and his first hit. \"Maybellene\" is considered one of the pioneering rock-and-roll songs: \"Rolling Stone\" magazine wrote, \"Rock & roll guitar starts here.\" The record is an early instance of the complete rock-and-roll package: youthful subject matter; a small, guitar-driven combo; clear diction; and an atmosphere of unrelenting excitement. The lyrics describe a man driving a V8 Ford chasing his unfaithful girlfriend in her Cadillac Coupe DeVille.

"Gifford Pinchot (August 11, 1865 - October 4, 1946) was an American forester and politician. Pinchot served as the first Chief of the United States Forest Service from 1905 until his firing in 1910, and was the 28th Governor of Pennsylvania, serving from 1923 to 1927, and again from 1931 to 1935. He was a member of the Republican Party for most of his life, though he also joined the Progressive Party for a brief period. Pinchot is known for reforming the management and development of forests in the United States and for advocating the conservation of the nation's reserves by planned use and renewal.\n"
"\n"
"Gifford Pinchot was born August 11, 1865, to Episcopalian parents in Simsbury, Connecticut, the son of James W. Pinchot, a successful New York City wallpaper merchant, and Mary Eno, daughter of one of New York City's wealthiest real estate developers, Amos Eno. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy and in 1889, Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. He had a brother Amos Pinchot and a sister Antoinette (who married the diplomat Alan Johnstone).  The Pinchots made a great fortune by importing French wallpaper  to furnish stately American homes during the late Victorian era. Pinchot's father  James made conservation a family affair and suggested that Gifford should become a forester, asking him just before he left for college in 1885, \"How would you like to become a forester?\". Gifford studied as a postgraduate at the French National School of Forestry, in Nancy, for a year. He returned home and plunged into the nascent forestry movement, intent on shaping a national forest policy. At Gifford's urging, together James and Gifford endowed the Yale School of Forestry in 1900, and James turned Grey Towers, the family estate at Milford, Pennsylvania, into a \"nursery\" for the American forestry movement. Family financial affairs were managed by brother Amos Pinchot, thus freeing Gifford to do the more important work of developing forest management concepts. Unlike some others in the forestry movement, Gifford's wealth allowed him to singly pursue this goal without worry of income.  Pinchot's approach set him apart from the other leading forestry experts, especially Bernhard E. Fernow and Carl A. Schenck. Fernow had been Pinchot's predecessor in the United States Department of Agriculture's Division of Forestry before leaving in 1898 to become the first Dean of the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell. Schenck was Pinchot's successor at the Biltmore Estate (widely recognized as the \"cradle of American forestry\") and founder of the Biltmore Forest School on Biltmore Estate. Their schools largely reflected their approaches to introducing forestry in the United States: Fernow advocated a regional approach and Schenck a private enterprise effort in contrast to Pinchot's national vision.  Perhaps, the men who had the most influence on his development as a forester were Sir Dietrich Brandis, who had brought forestry to the British Empire, and Sir Wilhelm Schlich, Brandis' successor. Pinchot relied heavily upon Brandis' advice for introducing professional forest management in the U.S. and on how to structure the Forest Service when Pinchot established it in 1905."

"Corker: Obama 'irresponsible' with Congress\n"
"\n"
"House Speaker John Boehner invited the Israeli prime minister to address Congress next month without either side consulting the White House before Netanyahu accepted the invitation, setting off sparks in an Obama administration that felt snubbed. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest called the planning for the visit a \"departure\" from protocol and comes amid tensions between the White House and Senators of both parties who want to pass a bill authorizing new sanctions on Iran -- a harder line Netanyahu has publicly supported.\n"
"\n"
"But Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, also suggested Tuesday that Netanyahu's visit would be less divisive by the time he arrives for his joint address to Congress.\n"
"\n"
"Corker wouldn't take a firm position on whether the unilateral invitation -- orchestrated by aides in Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's offices -- was the right thing to do.\n"
"\n"
"RELATED: Netanyahu coming to Congress in March\n"
"\n"
"\"At the end of the day, that's not my call,\" he told CNN's \"New Day\". \"There's a lot of water that will go under the bridge between now and the time that he arrives and my guess is we may be in a place where thing are aligned in a very good way.\"\n"
"\n"
"Corker is currently leading the push for a bill in the foreign affairs committee that would require Congressional oversight over an eventual deal with Iran while Sens. Bob Menendez (D-New Jersey) and Mark Kirk (R-Illinois) will push another bill through the banking committee next week that would hang a new set of sanctions on Iran's head if a deal isn't reached by the July deadline. Sens. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) and Barbara Boxer (D-California) also announced Wednesday that they are crafting a more moderate sanctions bill to counter the Kirk-Menendez bill.\n"
"\n"
"But by the time Netanyahu comes to visit, Corker suggested that Congress, the White House and Israel's conservative leader would likely be more in sync over how to strengthen the U.S.'s negotiating position with Iran ahead of an initial March 1 and final July 1 deadline for Iran to deal with the U.S. and five other world powers regarding its nuclear program.\n"
"\n"
"\"He's incredibly concerned about a bad deal with Iran, very concerned about where these negotiations are going,\" Corker said. \"I don't know that he'll be necessarily going against the President.\"\n"
"\n"
"That may be even more likely as Boehner's office announced Thursday morning that Netanyahu asked to push his visit back a month, now set to speak on March , giving him a chance to also address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's high-profile annual conference. His speech to Congress will now come just 12 days before Netanyahu appears on ballots in Israeli elections -- a visit that will bolster his status as a strong leader with firm backing in the United States for his policies.\n"
"\n"
"Netanyahu may also have to come to terms with information from his own intelligence service, which told a group of U.S. senators visiting Israel last week, including Corker, that a sanctions bill would threaten negotiations, according to a Bloomberg report and similar remarks made by Secretary of State John Kerry.\n"

"husband, and I don't mean that in a disparaging way. It's just that your free spirit and wanderlust would only be stifled by the constraints of a traditional marriage,\" she explained, her eyes soft and filled with understanding.\n"
"\n"
"Mikhail stared at her, marveling at how well she seemed to know him, even better than he knew himself. He was as much a traveler as he was a dreamer, always seeking new horizons and adventure. In his heart, he understood that the idea of settling down and creating a family with someone, while enticing, was not what he truly desired. Instead, he longed for a life filled with excitement and growth, of never-ending exploration.\n"
"\n"
"\"You're right,\" he reluctantly admitted, feeling a mix of admiration and frustration at her insight. \"I often imagine a life where I can roam the world without any chains, meeting new people, experiencing different cultures, tasting exotic flavors, and appreciating the beauty of this vast planet.\"\n"
"\n"
"As she listened to his passionate words, her smile grew tender, and her eyes glimmered with a mischievous spark. \"You're a rare soul, Mikhail, and that's precisely what I love about you. Do you remember that time we stayed up all night, talking about the farthest corners of the world we wanted to explore, and the infinite number of experiences that awaited us?\" she asked, her mind wandering to a fond memory.\n"
"\n"
"He recalled that night vividly - the excitement coursing through their veins, the twinkle in her eyes as they'd shared their deepest desires and aspirations. \"Of course, that was the night I realized how incredible you are, and how deeply connected we are. It's as if we were made for each other - two wandering souls on similar life paths, destined to meet.\"\n"
"\n"
"Her eyes met his, and she nodded. \"That's how I feel, too. So, let me counter your question with another proposal. Instead of asking for my hand in marriage, how about we make a different kind of commitment to each other?\" Mikhail tilted his head, intrigued by the idea.\n"
"\n"
"\"What if we promise to be lifelong travel partners and companions, united not by a legal contract, but by our shared love for adventure and the unknown? We can explore the world together, seeking out the hidden gems, the breathtaking landscapes, and the stories that need to be told.\" There was a palpable excitement in her voice, and he felt his own heart race at the prospect.\n"
"\n"
"Mikhail was taken aback by the brilliance of her suggestion and felt a newfound appreciation for her creativity and willingness to forge their own path. The idea resonated deeply with his own yearning for a life filled with wonderful experiences and growth.\n"
"\n"
"\"That's... that's perfect,\" he agreed, his face breaking into a wide grin. \"I couldn't imagine a better way for us to share our lives. Thank you for being so wise, so understanding, and most of all, for being you.\"\n"
"\n"
"As they held hands, gazing deeply into each other's eyes, they felt an unwavering sense of solidarity. For they were two wandering souls, choosing to embark on the greatest adventure of their lives – together. And through their unique love, Mikhail and his beloved partner would redefine the meaning of commitment, forming a bond that transcended the boundaries of convention and dared to seek the unknown."

"The process of fossil formation consists of several stages, namely: the death of animals and plants in soft soil or mud, sedimentation and accumulation of materials over the remains, decomposition of organic matter, replacement of the remaining parts with minerals, and finally, the formation of a fossil. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that in a situation where animals and plants die in soft soil less often, there will be a consequential effect on the formation of fossils. This hypothesis has both direct and indirect effects on the fossil formation process.\n"
"\n"
"Direct effects of the perturbation hypothesis:\n"
"\n"
"The most significant direct effect of the perturbation hypothesis on the fossil formation process is the reduction in the number of potential fossils. When animals and plants die in soft soil less often, there are simply fewer remains available to become fossils. As a result, the overall probability of fossil formation decreases because the first and fundamental step in the process is diminished. \n"
"\n"
"Since sedimentation and accumulation of materials over the remains are directly associated with the initial deposition of the remains, a decrease in the number of organisms dying in soft soil will lead to less sediment covering their remains. This can result in a lowered chance of preservation and eventual fossilization. In turn, fewer fossils will be found compared to a scenario where more animals and plants die within soft sediments.\n"
"\n"
"Indirect effects of the perturbation hypothesis:\n"
"\n"
"The perturbation hypothesis can also lead to indirect effects on the fossil formation process. For instance, a reduced rate of animals and plants dying in soft soil may influence the ecological balance and competition between organisms. Over time, this can lead to shifts in species populations and characteristics, which might consequently be reflected in the available fossil record.\n"
"\n"
"Additionally, a reduction in the number of organisms dying in soft sediment may indirectly affect the rate of sedimentation and accumulation of materials. In some cases, this can impede the natural burial and preservation processes necessary for fossil formation. As an alternative, remains might become exposed to predators, scavengers, or physical and chemical erosion, which could further impact the existing fossil record.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, the perturbation hypothesis could have knock-on effects on the overall process of decomposition and replacement of the remaining parts with minerals. This could be primarily due to the changes in sedimentation rates or the availability of minerals required for the replacement process. Consequently, these alterations can have a substantial bearing on the quality and completeness of the fossils that are ultimately formed.\n"
"\n"
"In summary, the perturbation hypothesis that supposes animals and plants die in soft soil less often has both direct and indirect impacts on the fossil formation process. Directly, it decreases the number of potential fossils, while indirectly, it can lead to a range of consequences, such as shifts in species populations, habitat characteristics, and the overall fossilization process. Therefore, a reduction in the number of organisms dying in soft soil can indeed lead to fewer fossils being formed."

"Answer the following question: Information:  - Troy (\"Troia\" and , \"Ilion\", or , \"Ilios\"; and ; Hittite: \"Wilusha\" or \"Truwisha\") was a city situated in the far northwest of the region known in late Classical antiquity as Asia Minor, now known as Anatolia in modern Turkey, near (just south of) the southwest mouth of the Dardanelles strait and northwest of Mount Ida. The present-day location is known as Hisarlik. It was the setting of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle, in particular in the \"Iliad\", one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer. Metrical evidence from the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" suggests that the name (\"Ilion\") formerly began with a digamma: (\"Wilion\"); this is also supported by the Hittite name for what is thought to be the same city, Wilusa.  - In Greek mythology, Hector (\"Hektr\") was a Trojan prince and the greatest fighter for Troy in the Trojan War. As the first-born son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba, who was a descendant of Dardanus and Tros, the founder of Troy, he was a prince of the royal house and the heir apparent to his father's throne. He was married to Andromache, with whom he had an infant son, Scamandrius (whom the people of Troy called Astyanax). He acted as leader of the Trojans and their allies in the defense of Troy, \"killing 31,000 Greek fighters\", offers Hyginus. During the European Middle Ages, Hector figures as one of the Nine Worthies noted by Jacques de Longuyon, known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, Homer places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. James Redfield writes of Hector as a \"martyr to loyalties, a witness to the things of this world, a hero ready to die for the precious imperfections of ordinary life.\"  - The Dardanelles, also known in Classical Antiquity as the Hellespont (\"Hellespontos\", literally \"Sea of Helle\"), is a narrow, natural strait and internationally-significant waterway in northwestern Turkey that forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey. One of the world's narrowest straits used for international navigation, the Dardanelles connects the Sea of Marmara with the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas, while also allowing passage to the Black Sea by extension via the Bosphorus.  - In Greek mythology , Polyxena ( / plksn / ; Greek :  ) was the youngest daughter of King Priam of Troy and his queen , Hecuba .  - Cassandra (, also ), also known as Alexandra or Kassandra, was a daughter of King Priam and of Queen Hecuba of Troy. In modern usage her name is employed as a rhetorical device to indicate someone whose accurate prophecies are not believed by those around them.  - Hecuba (also \"Hecabe\", \"Hécube\"; \"Hekáb\") was a queen in Greek mythology, the wife of King Priam of Troy during the Trojan War, with whom she had 19 children. These children included several major characters of Homer's \"Iliad\" such as the warriors Hector and Paris and the prophetess Cassandra.

"My review in one word - disappointing. How about two words? Very disappointing. We were so excited to try this place after strong yelp reviews and friends' recommendations so we saved our first visit for my birthday. 6:15 Saturday night reservations started off great. Seated right away, asked if we had theater plans so they could make sure they tended us in a timely manner. Seemed like a great beginning. That was when it went downhill.   The two of us were seated along the wall where the \" tables\" for two are located. These tables are woefully small and completely inadequate for any dinner setting. And they are so close together!! They are essentially thigh width apart!! There should be a minimum state requirement of butt width for goodness sake! Even the skinny busboys couldn't wedge themselves in there. When your chair is wider than the table, you know it's bad. Makes for a very disruptive dining experience when your neighbor leaves. Plus, I think the fire marshall should have a look at this. Can't be safe. When I say close together, I mean the plates of the diners on either side of me were just as close to me as my wife's across the table! Everything was in arms reach. I wanted a table for two, not a party of six. I am not that interested in your life, trust me.   Beer served in cans is not my style but I did one anyway. Arrived warm. Wanted to try the smoked wings we'd heard about so we started with those and the curry mussels. Both came out together and we literally had to stack them on top of each other on the table since it was so tiny. Ridiculous. The wings were the best thing all night - good, not great. I'm a huge mussels fan and was excited when they arrived looking fresh and delish. They were large but not delish. There was NO flavor. Bland with a capital B. No curry flavor at all - I think the steaming liquid would have tasted better.  Did the spice cabinet turn out to be empty? Nice quantity though. Just not what I would have expected. Frankly I could have stopped eating here - and wish I had.   We had placed our entire order at one time. I ordered the brisket sandwich and my wife the short rib flatbread. Between appetizers and entree was at least 50 minutes. At one point I was finally able to grab our server ( where DOES she does disappear to?) and told her, if it's not out now, just cancel the order. She had stopped by 25 minutes prior and said they'd be out in one minute. Wrong.  Amazingly, mine came out but she dropped the flat bread in the kitchen.  Service disaster. Let's just say 2 1/2 hours is way too long for what we had. One hour waits between courses? Absurd. Service was among the worst I've ever experienced. And the brisket? After 3 bites I put my utensils down. Not good at all. Another flavorless serving. Flatbread? Awful. Short rib my eye. If there was more than an ounce of short rib on there I'll buy your next meal.   I feel bad giving it two stars but that was what my experience calls for. Oh, and the very limited draft beer menu? No Oktoberfest at all. Instead, a summer session ale? I mean, come on guys - this is October! There's no excuse for that. And at $7 and $10 each for our drafts, this is not a place I'd even want to drink.\n"

"In 2009, Fernandez traveled to India for a modeling assignment. She studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John, and successfully auditioned for Sujoy Ghosh's fantasy film Aladin (2009) her acting debut. She played the love interest of Riteish Deshmukh's character, a role based on the character of Princess Jasmine. and Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN felt that she was: \"easy on the eyes and appears confident but has precious little to do\". Although the film was a critical and commercial failure, she won the IIFA Award for Star Debut of the Year - Female.  In 2010, Fernandez appeared opposite Deshmukh in the science fiction romantic comedy Jaane Kahan Se Aayi Hai. She was cast as a girl from Venus, who lands on Earth in search of love. The film, along with Fernandez's performance, received poor reviews; Rediff.com's Sukanya Verma noted: \"She gamely makes a fool of herself whilst aping the actions of movie stars, ranging from Sridevi's Naagin dance, Mithun Chakravarthy's Disco Dancer moves, to Big B's violent headshake in Hum. Her Tara could be a keeper if only Jaane Kahan Se Aayi Hai wasn't so intent on turning her into a love-struck Barbie.\" Critic Anupama Chopra also criticized Fernandez, calling her \"a pin-prick on a balloon\". Later that year, she made a special appearance in the song \"Dhanno\" for Sajid Khan's comedy Housefull.  Mahesh Bhatt's thriller Murder 2 was Fernandez's first commercial success and marked a turning point in her career. She took on the role of Priya, a lonely model who is in a confused relationship with Arjun Bhagwat (played by Emraan Hashmi). Fernandez was praised for her performance, and for the boldness and sex appeal she displayed in the film. Gaurav Malini of The Times of India stated that she was \"tastefully tempting\" but noted that her romance with Hashmi was \"literally half-baked\". The following year, Fernandez appeared in the ensemble comedy Housefull 2 alongside Akshay Kumar, John Abraham, and Asin. It became one of the top grossing productions of India that year and earned Rs1.86 billion (US$28 million) worldwide. Fernandez received mostly negative reviews for her performance. While Gaurav Malini praised her for her looks, NDTV called her a \"blathering bimbo\" who \"find[s] no pleasure in [her role]\". Despite the negative reviews, Fernandez received a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the 14th IIFA Awards for her performance.  Fernandez's first release of 2013 was Race 2, an ensemble action thriller (alongside Saif Ali Khan, John Abraham and Deepika Padukone), described as the \"cinematic equivalent of a trashy novel\" by critic Rajeev Masand. She played Omisha, a femme fatale, a role which required her learn fencing and some acrobatics. The film emerged as a commercial success, with the domestic gross of more than Rs1 billion (US$15 million). In a particularly scathing review, Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV wrote that both Fernandez and Padukone \"strut around like wound-up automatons that are all decked-up but have nowhere to go.\" Also that year, Fernandez appeared in an item number, titled, \"Jaadu Ki Jhappi\", for Prabhu Deva's romantic comedy Ramaiya Vasta Vaiya.\n"

"\n"
"Yelberton Abraham Tittle Jr. (October 24, 1926 - October 8, 2017), better known as Y. A. Tittle, was a professional American football quarterback. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, New York Giants, and Baltimore Colts, after spending two seasons with the Colts in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Known for his competitiveness, leadership, and striking profile, Tittle was the centerpiece of several prolific offenses throughout his seventeen-year professional career from 1948 to 1964. Tittle played college football for Louisiana State University, where he was a two-time All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) quarterback for the LSU Tigers football team.\n"
"\n"
"At the time of his retirement, Tittle held the following NFL records:  Tittle was the fourth player to throw seven touchdown passes in a game, when he did so in 1962 against the Redskins. He followed Sid Luckman (1943), Adrian Burk (1954), and George Blanda (1961). The feat has since been equaled by four more players: Joe Kapp (1969), Peyton Manning (2013), Nick Foles (2013), and Drew Brees (2015). Tittle, Manning and Foles did it without an interception. His 36 touchdown passes in 1963 set a record which stood for over two decades until it was surpassed by Dan Marino in 1984; as of 2016 it remains a Giants franchise record.  Despite record statistics and three straight championship game appearances, Tittle was never able to deliver a title to his team. His record as a starter in postseason games was 0-4. He threw four touchdown passes against 14 interceptions and had a passer rating of 33.8 in his postseason career, far below his regular season passer rating of 74.3. Seth Wickersham, writing for ESPN The Magazine in 2014, noted the dichotomy in the 1960s between two of New York's major sports franchises: \"... Gifford, Huff and Tittle, a team of Hall of Famers known for losing championships as their peers on the Yankees--with whom they shared a stadium, a city, and many rounds of drinks--became renowned for winning them.\" The Giants struggled after Tittle's retirement, posting only two winning seasons from 1964 to 1980.  He made seven Pro Bowls, four first-team All-Pro teams, and four times was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player or Player of the Year: in 1957 and 1962 by the UPI; in 1961 by the NEA; and in 1963 by the AP and NEA. In a sports column in 1963, George Strickler for the Chicago Tribune remarked Tittle had \"broken records that at one time appeared unassailable and he has been the hero of more second half rallies than Napoleon and the Harlem Globetrotters.\" He was featured on four Sports Illustrated covers: three during his playing career and one shortly after retirement. His first was with the 49ers in 1954. With the Giants, he graced covers in November 1961, and he was on the season preview issue for 1964; a two-page fold-out photo from the 1963 title game. Tittle was on a fourth cover in August 1965.  The trade of Tittle for Lou Cordileone is seen as one of the worst trades in 49ers history; it is considered one of the best trades in Giants franchise history. Cordileone played just one season in San Francisco.\n"

Opt for tailored suits, fitted dress shirts, or sleek blouses that accentuate your body without being too tight or revealing. A well-fitted outfit will not only accentuate your toned figure, but it will also give you a confident aura while maintaining a professional appearance.\n"
"\n"
"Step 2: Incorporate Appropriate Colors and Patterns\n"
"\n"
"Colors and patterns can greatly enhance your attire and help show off your physical attributes. Dark shades, such as navy blue, black, or charcoal, provide a slimming effect and generally look more professional. These colors can be contrasted with lighter, more vibrant shades for a pop of visual interest. Vertical stripes can also create an elongating and slimming effect, drawing the eye to your toned physique.\n"
"\n"
"Step 3: Opt for High-Quality Fabrics\n"
"\n"
"Investing in high-quality fabrics will ensure that your clothing retains its form, feels comfortable on your body, and withstands washes and usage. High-quality fabrics can adapt to your body shape and look more polished, allowing your sculpted frame to stand out.\n"
"\n"
"Step 4: Choose the Right Accessories\n"
"\n"
"Accessories can enhance your overall look while adding a professional touch. Men can opt for leather belts, cufflinks, and ties, while women can choose tasteful jewelry and a flattering belt to subtly draw attention to their waistline. A high-quality timepiece, like a classic watch, can demonstrate your attention to detail and reflect a sense of sophistication and style without overtly drawing attention to your physique.\n"
"\n"
"Step 5: Confidence is Key\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, one should never overlook the importance of a confident attitude. A positive demeanor and self-assured body language can go a long way in enhancing your appearance and highlighting your fitness achievements. Stand tall, walk with purpose, and project a magnetic energy into every room you enter to showcase your muscles subtly yet powerfully.\n"
"\n"
"Conclusion:\n"
"\n"
"Dressing to accentuate your toned physique while maintaining a professional image is all about finding the perfect balance. By selecting clothing that fits well, incorporating appropriate colors and patterns, investing in high-quality fabrics, and accessorizing wisely, you can showcase your hard work without compromising your polished appearance. Most importantly, remember that a confident attitude completes the look, reflecting the strength and determination that went into crafting your impressive physique."

"Brutus.1, developed in the 1990s by two researchers, Selmer Bringsjord and David Ferrucci, is an artificial intelligence-based computer program designed to generate brief outbursts of fiction, known as story generations, that are thought to be on par with or even superior to many human-authored literary works. The program's unique ability to create high-quality narrative texts has intrigued many, raising questions about both the technical aspects of this AI software and its potential implications for the field of creative writing.\n"
"\n"
"To thoroughly understand Brutus.1, we must first acknowledge its foundation in AI research. This program relies on a combination of knowledge representation, natural language processing (NLP), and logical theorem proving technologies. Knowledge representation entails encoding real-world knowledge in a way that enables machines to reason with that knowledge in a human-like way. NLP is the field responsible for breaking down human languages into forms that machines can understand, while logical theorem proving helps in constructing high-level human-like reasoning based on provided data and information.\n"
"\n"
"By utilizing these techniques, Brutus.1 was able to generate authentic and complex storylines that were difficult to distinguish from those composed by humans. The program was built around a specific genre of fiction: stories of betrayal. It was fed a set of rules associated with this theme, allowing it to generate narratives that are both engaging and contextually appropriate. This focus on one theme is essential for the success of Brutus.1, as it limits the narrative scope and requires a more precise understanding of relevant situations, characters, and relationships.\n"
"\n"
"The stories generated by Brutus.1 tend to consist of a central betrayal, often involving a friend or colleague, and the ensuing emotional and practical consequences. By drawing on its knowledge base, the program can create realistic characters with complex motivations and emotions. These characters interact and evolve within the narrative, creating unexpected twists and surprising outcomes that are characteristic of the betrayal genre.\n"
"\n"
"Arguably, the most significant implication of a program like Brutus.1 is its potential to transform the landscape of creative writing, as it challenges traditional notions of creativity and authorship. Critics argue that machines lack the emotional depth, personal experiences, and intuition that humans draw upon when crafting impactful stories, while proponents of AI-generated literature claim that AI can become a valuable tool for writers by providing suggestions, ideas, and alternatives for their work.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, Brutus.1 is a pioneering computer program in the field of AI-generated fiction that uses advanced technologies, such as knowledge representation, natural language processing, and logical theorem proving, to create engaging stories focused on betrayal. By generating high-quality narratives that rival human-authored stories, this program not only demonstrates the growing potential of AI in the world of creative writing but also ignites a broader conversation on the role of machines in the creative process and the nature of authorship in the age of artificial intelligence."

"I'll start by apologizing to filmmakers everywhere for using the terms \"filmmaker\", \"film\", or \"movie\" in connection with this, but \"criminal\" and \"crime against humanity\" seem a bit harsh.\n"
"\n"
"The writing: pathetic.\n"
"\n"
"The directing: pathetic.\n"
"\n"
"The acting: pathetic.\n"
"\n"
"The cinematography: too inept for words.\n"
"\n"
"The technical skills used to assemble this atrocity: NONE WHATSOEVER.\n"
"\n"
"This lump of waste could hardly be called cinema. The majority of family home movies come closer to earning that distinction than Revenge Quest. No, this is just a 10 car pile-up caught on video.\n"
"\n"
"We'll skip the plot in this review, because there are far too many holes to be covered at once. Let's just say that it stinks worse than the rest of this movie. To call the acting one-dimensional would be giving them credit. What little there is, is atrocious to begin with, and made much worse by the terrible video and editing.\n"
"\n"
"The worst part of this atrocity, though, apart from the plot, would have to be the effects... or rather the disturbing lack thereof. There are no blanks in the guns, no flashpots, and what few sound effects existed were either stock \"gun\" sounds, or they were generated by mouth (yeah, you read that right). The filmmaker actually had the audacity to record a \"shh\" sound for the elevator doors; I guess he felt it made them sound more futuristic. This is supposed to be set in the year 2031, after all. That doesn't explain the sounds he created by mouth for the fist-fight scenes, however.\n"
"\n"
"If it wasn't bad enough that the sound quality is terrible (he just used the microphone that was mounted on the video camera, and it shows), the use of stock gun sounds was almost worse than not using any sounds at all. The sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack like a drunken yak in a herd of sheep, and they're just as clumsy. Picture this: The bad guy enters an office building searching for his prey. A lady starts to run in fear. He raises his gun (an uzi), and shakes it. We hear a sound that is clearly not an uzi. The woman runs away from camera, and suddenly a single blood pack (only 1) explodes on her back (looked like she was hit by a paintball), and she falls flat on her face.\n"
"\n"
"Bear in mind that my description does far too much justice to the ineptitude of the actual sequence.\n"
"\n"
"In another sequence, one which almost- but not quite- makes the movie funny enough to watch, takes place in a stairwell. The bad guy chases the good guy and the lady he's protecting down the stairs, shaking his plastic uzi all the way. You may wish to duck; there are badly timed sound effects flying all over the place.\n"
"\n"
"I supposed Alan DeHerrera can't be locked away for conceiving of this train wreck, but he did follow through all the way to editing and releasing it. If there's any justice, there's bound to be some karma out there with his name on it.\n"
"\n"
"Should you decide to watch this lump of industrial waste- and I would strongly advise against it- be sure to watch for the entire scenes lifted nearly verbatim from Bladerunner, and the AM radio that doubles as a walkie-talkie. Try not to focus too hard on the plot; it will only hurt you more if you do.\n"

"Remy's decision to buy a new jacket and subsequently store it in their closet without ever wearing it can lead to a variety of outcomes and consequences. Although it may be impossible to predict the precise trajectory of Remy's life based on this single action alone, we can explore some potential scenarios and factors that may influence their situation.\n"
"\n"
"1. Sense of satisfaction: Initially, Remy may have experienced gratification and happiness from purchasing the new jacket. This could be due to a personal preference for the style, the excitement of acquiring a new possession, or even retail therapy. However, the fact that Remy has chosen not to wear the jacket suggests that this satisfaction may be short-lived.\n"
"\n"
"2. Emotional attachment: One possible explanation for Remy's reluctance to wear the jacket is the formation of an emotional attachment to the item. In this case, Remy might be hesitant to risk damaging or dirtying the jacket, leading them to preserve it in their closet. This attachment could result in mixed feelings - both pride in owning such a coveted item and frustration at not being able to enjoy it fully.\n"
"\n"
"3. Financial consequences: Depending on the cost of the jacket, Remy may experience financial consequences of their purchase. If the jacket was relatively expensive, they might feel guilty or regretful about spending money on an item that they are not using. Alternatively, if the jacket was more affordable, the financial impact may be negligible.\n"
"\n"
"4. Social impact: If Remy's friends and family are aware of the new jacket, they may inquire as to why it has not been worn yet. Depending on Remy's reasons for not wearing the jacket, they may experience embarrassment, annoyance, or even pressure to wear it. Additionally, if Remy tends to make impulsive purchases frequently, this behavior could negatively impact their relationships with others or lead to a reputation for being financially irresponsible.\n"
"\n"
"5. Personal growth and reflection: Reflecting on this experience, Remy may decide to be more mindful of their decisions regarding future purchases. They may analyze the factors that led them to buy the jacket in the first place and strive to develop a better understanding of their needs and desires. This could result in more thoughtful decision-making and less impulsive behavior.\n"
"\n"
"6. Reaching a decision: Ultimately, there are several possible paths Remy may choose to take with regard to the jacket. They may decide to confront any emotional attachment and begin wearing it, sell or donate the jacket to someone who will appreciate it, or perhaps even continue to store it in their closet as a reminder of their past behavior. Whichever path they choose, it is essential for Remy to find a resolution that aligns with their values, needs, and personal growth.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the outcomes of Remy's action to purchase a jacket and not wear it are influenced by multiple factors, including personal feelings, financial implications, social repercussions, and opportunities for personal growth. While it is impossible to predict the precise impact this event may have on Remy's life, it is essential for them to recognize and learn from their experiences and strive for self-improvement and thoughtful decision-making."

"Question: Hannah sold 40 pieces of cookies for $0.8 each and 30 cupcakes for $2 each. She used the money to buy 2 sets of measuring spoons for $6.5 each. How much money does she have left?\n"
"Answer: Hannah's earnings from the cookies is 40 x $0.8 = $32. Her earnings from the cupcakes is 30 x $2 = $60. Her total earnings for the cupcakes and cookies is $32 + $60 = $92. The cost of 2 sets of measuring spoons is 2 x $6.5 = $13. So, Hannah has $92 - $13 = $79. The answer is 79.\n"
"[Question]A salon has the same amount of customers every day. Each customer needs 1 can of hairspray during the styling and is also given 1 can of hairspray to take home. The salon also buys an extra 5 cans of hairspray each day to ensure there is never a shortage. If the salon buys 33 cans of hairspray every day, how many customers do they have each day?\n"
"[Answer]Removing the surplus hairspray shows the salon needs 33 total cans of hairspray – 5 surplus cans of hairspray = 28 cans of hairspray for each customer. Each customer needs 1 can of hairspray for styling + 1 can of hairspray to take home = 2 cans of hairspray. So the salon has a total of 28 cans of hairspray / 2 cans of hairspray per customer = 14 customers. The answer is 14.\n"
"Q: Bill is laying power cable for a new neighborhood. There are going to be 18 east-west streets that are 2 miles long and 10 north-south streets that are four miles long. It takes 5 miles of cable to electrify 1 mile of street. If cable costs $2000/mile, what is the total cost of cable for the neighborhood?\n"
"A: First find the total distance of the east - west streets: 18 streets * 2 miles / street = 36 miles. Then find the total distance of the north - south streets: 10 streets * 4 miles / street = 40 miles. Then add the number of miles from each type of street to find the total distance: 36 miles + 40 miles = 76 miles. Then multiply that number by 5 to find the number of miles of cable needed: 76 miles street * 5 miles cable / mile street = 380 miles of cable. Then multiply that number by the cost of one mile of cable to find the total cost: 380 miles * $2000 / mile = $760,000. The answer is 760000.\n"
"Question: Farmer Brown raises emus, large birds. His flock has a total of 60 heads and legs. How many emus are in his flock?\n"

"[Answer]There were 60 guests / 2 = 30 women at my mother's birthday celebration. There were 30 women + 15 men = 45 men and women. So, 60 people - 45 men and women = 15 were children. Then, 15 men / 3 = 5 men left. Thus, 5 men + 5 children = 10 people left. Therefore, 60 people - 10 people = 50 people stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration. The answer is 50.\n"

We can break down and analyze these reasons to understand her actions better, which eventually resulted in her having to consume cookies every night for a while.\n"
"\n"
"1. Personal interests and hobbies: Aubrey might be passionate about baking and trying out different recipes. For some people, the kitchen serves as a creative and therapeutic space where they can unwind, relax, and express themselves through the art of baking. As a home cook, Aubrey could be indulging in her curiosity for exploring different ingredients, flavor combinations, and developing a wide array of baking techniques. This enthusiasm for baking drove her to make an excess of cookies.\n"
"\n"
"2. Skill enhancement and practice: It is often said that \"practice makes perfect.\" Aubrey might have been working on improving her baking skills by making a variety of cookies, and as such, continued baking to ensure she gained valuable hands-on experience. It's possible that she utilized different recipes as a way to broaden her knowledge, refine her skills, and become adept in the art of cookie-making. This quest for perfection and the need to experiment and fine-tune her skills could have led her to bake more cookies than necessary.\n"
"\n"
"3. Exposure to new recipes: In today's digital age, a plethora of recipes is available at our fingertips. Aubrey could have stumbled upon a goldmine of cookie recipes through social media, food blogs, cooking shows, or cookbooks.

"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?\n"
"Some exercises that require weights can be done without weights. If you don't have time to hit the gym, you can do calisthenics almost anywhere.  To do an air squat, set up as if you were in front of the squat rack at the gym. Put your feet a little more than shoulder width apart, with your toes facing outward. Using the same form you would in weighted squats, lower your hips and push your butt back. To help keep your balance, push your arms out in front of you as you lower down.  Lunges can be performed without weights very easily. The form is exactly the same with or without weights. To do a glute kickback, set up as if you were going to do a push-up, but stay on your knees. Lift one leg off the ground until your thigh is parallel to the ground. Keep your shin perpendicular to the ground and push your leg up. Lower you leg slowly and repeat with the other leg. To do a short bridge, lie flat on your back with the bottoms of your feet on the floor and your knees at about 45 degrees. Keep your shoulders and arms on the floor. Push up using your heels and raise your hips up as high as possible. Hold at the top for two seconds. Slowly lower your body back to the ground.  Once you've mastered the short bridge, try doing a straight bridge. The straight bridge is a lot like a reverse push up. Sitting up with your legs straight in front of you, place your hands near your hips. Push your torso up and squeeze your butt. Hold for a few seconds before lowering back down.  To do a full bridge, lie flat on your back. Bend your knees and place your hands by your head. Lift your entire body off the ground and arch your back. Push your hips into the air and squeeze your legs, butt, and core. Take a deep breath and make sure you give everything a good stretch. Hold for a 1-2 seconds and then lower yourself back down. Lie down on your side and rest your head on your bottom arm. Place your other arm palm down in front of you body. Keep both of your legs straight and lift your top leg about 1 foot off of your bottom leg. Lift your bottom leg to meet your top leg. Slowly lower both legs to the ground. Another variation is to lie flat on your back with your legs straight in front of you. Slowly lift your legs off the ground to a 90-degree angle. Hold for one second and then lower your legs taking care not to let them touch the ground. Running is a great way to tone your legs and butt. Any kind of running is likely to improve your lower body, but sprinting might be the best way.  For an added challenge, run up a hill. Hill sprints will improve your glutes by putting more stress on your hip flexors.  Running is a high impact activity and may not be good for your joints. If you can't run, try using an elliptical machine or a stationary bike. There are numerous exercises that workout your glutes and lower body. Do some research and find some new exercises to incorporate into your routine. Some people find that adding new exercises keeps them motivated to keep working out.  Try out a hip thrust exercise for something a little different. You could also try joining a yoga class. Yoga is an excellent way to strengthen your muscles, increase flexibility, and tone your body.\n"

"Inga DeCarlo Fung Marchand (born September 6, 1978), better known by her stage name Foxy Brown, is an American rapper, model, and actress. She is best known for her solo work, as well as numerous collaborations with other artists and her brief stint as part of hip hop group The Firm. Raised in Brooklyn, New York, her father Winston Marchand abandoned the family at a young age to pursue his career at ERAC records. Her albums include Ill Na Na in 1996, followed by Chyna Doll in 1999, and Grammy-nominated Broken Silence in 2001.\n"
"\n"
"While still a teenager, Brown won a talent contest in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Members of the production team Trackmasters who were working on LL Cool J's Mr. Smith album were in attendance that night and were impressed enough to invite Brown to rap over \"I Shot Ya.\" She followed this debut with appearances on several RIAA platinum and gold singles from other artists, including remixes of songs \"You're Makin' Me High\" by Toni Braxton. Brown was also featured on the soundtrack to the 1996 film The Nutty Professor, on the songs \"Touch Me Tease Me\" by Case and \"Ain't No Nigga\" by Jay-Z. The immediate success led to a label bidding war at the beginning of 1996, and in March, Def Jam Records won and added the then 17-year-old rapper to their roster. In 1996, Foxy Brown, Lil' Kim, Da Brat, and Total got together for the recording of Bad Boy's remix of \"No One Else\". This was the only track that Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown appeared on together, the two were friends at the time.  In 1996, Brown released her debut album Ill Na Na to mixed reviews but strong sales. The album sold over 109,000 copies in the first week, and debuted at #7 on the Billboard 200 album charts. The album was heavily produced by Trackmasters, and featured guest appearances from Jay-Z, Blackstreet, Method Man, and Kid Capri. The album went on to go platinum and launched two hit singles: \"Get Me Home\" (featuring Blackstreet) and \"I'll Be\" (featuring Jay-Z).  Following the release of Ill Na Na, Brown joined fellow New York-based hip hop artists, Nas, AZ, and Nature to form the supergroup known as The Firm. The album was released via Aftermath Records and was produced and recorded by the collective team of Dr. Dre, The Trackmasters, and Steve \"Commissioner\" Stoute, then of Violator Entertainment. An early form of The Firm appeared on \"Affirmative Action\", from Nas' second album, It Was Written. A remix of the song, and several group freestyles were in the album, Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ, and Nature Present The Firm: The Album. The album entered the Billboard 200 album chart at #1 and sold over half a million records and is RIAA certified gold.  In March 1997, she joined the spring break festivities hosted by MTV in Panama City, Florida, among other performers including rapper Snoop Dogg, pop group The Spice Girls, and rock band Stone Temple Pilots. Later, she joined the Smokin' Grooves tour hosted by the House of Blues with the headlining rap group Cypress Hill, along with other performers like Erykah Badu, The Roots, OutKast, and The Pharcyde, the tour set to begin in Boston, Massachusetts, in the summer of 1997. However, after missing several dates in the tour, she left it."

"Plot: The Big Apple Circus is a heartwarming film that revolves around a struggling yet talented circus troupe from a small Midwestern town called Sunnyside. Coined as the \"Sunny Skies Circus Troupe,\" the team aspires to be recognized and prove their worth in the world of circus arts and entertainment. When a renowned New York City Broadway event producer, Victor Mansfield, discovers the troupe's awe-inspiring performances, he invites them to showcase their talent in New York City as part of a prestigious annual circus festival. \n"
"\n"
"In the beginning, the Sunny Skies Circus Troupe is initially hesitant as they grapple with the possibility of leaving their hometown and have doubtful thoughts about competing against much larger circus acts. Their leader, Ethan, encourages the troupe to grasp the opportunity to chase their dreams and achieve the recognition they deserve. Together with the team's determination and passion, they embark on a journey to prepare for the performances of their lives.\n"
"\n"
"As the troupe arrives in New York City, they are overwhelmed by the grandness of everything in the so-called \"concrete jungle.\" It is here that the members of the Sunny Skies Circus Troupe must confront their fears and rattle against all odds. With a blend of comedy, drama, and thrilling moments, the film explores the character arcs of the troupe members, such as Veronica, the trapeze artist overcoming her fear of heights, and Oliver, the magician, honing his skills to deliver a mind-boggling performance for New Yorkers. The film also highlights the troupe's growing bonds as they navigate the city together and experience its vibrant culture. \n"
"\n"
"As the days inch closer to the grand performance at the annual circus festival, tensions run high, heightened by the mounting pressure and expectations to succeed on such a massive platform. A rival circus troupe, Sky High Flyers, consistently taunts and attempts to undermine the Sunny Skies Circus Troupe throughout the film. The rival team's leader, Darius, is especially eager to stop the newcomers from stealing the spotlight. However, the Sunny Skies Circus Troupe remains focused on their goal and works tirelessly to perfect their acts. \n"
"\n"
"On the day of the grand performance, unexpected mishaps occur, such as essential props going missing and dangerous traffic delaying their arrival at the venue. Instead of giving up, the troupe bands together, using their wit and ingenuity to overcome the hurdles that stand in their way. They arrive at the festival just in time, ready to perform their hearts out.\n"
"\n"
"In the end, the Sunny Skies Circus Troupe astonishes the crowd with a breathtaking fusion of circus art, athleticism, and entertainment. New Yorkers laud their performance, while Victor is left in awe of their potential. Moreover, they manage to win the hearts of the rival troupe, who grudgingly show admiration for their success.\n"
"\n"
"Filled with laughter, tears, and excitement, The Big Apple Circus is a testament to the enduring power of friendship, dreams, and triumph. The film concludes on a high note, as the Sunny Skies Circus Troupe shows the world that the greatest success stems from believing in one's talents and hard work, regardless of where they come from."

"In the context of the development of Optimality Theory at the LSA summer institute in 1991 by Alan Prince and Paul Smolensky, the concept of constraints and their importance in phonology and morphology is crucial for understanding the overall architecture of languages. The main idea of Optimality Theory is that languages choose the pronunciation of a word that best satisfies a list of constraints that are ordered by importance, allowing for a lower-ranked constraint to be violated in order to obey a higher-ranked constraint.\n"

"Regarding the question of which aspect – phonology or morphology – has more importance with constraints, it is essential to first understand the distinction between the two. Phonology is the study of the distribution and patterning of speech sounds, or phonemes, in a language while morphology is concerned with the structure and formation of words through the combination of morphemes, which are the smallest units of meaning in a language.\n"
"\n"
"In Optimality Theory, both phonological and morphological constraints play significant roles in determining the pronunciation and structure of words in a language. However, their importance may vary depending on the specific linguistic context and the properties of the language in question.\n"
"\n"
"In the original development of Optimality Theory, the primary focus was on phonological constraints. These constraints govern aspects such as syllable structure, assimilation, and stress placement in a language. The theory suggests that languages have an inventory of possible phonological constraints, and each language has its own specific ranking of these constraints, which determines the possible pronunciations of a word.\n"
"\n"
"Soon after the introduction of Optimality Theory, its scope was extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince. Morphological constraints deal with issues such as the arrangement of morphemes in a word, the selection of specific allomorphs (variant forms of a morpheme), and the realization of inflectional and derivational morphology in a language. Like phonological constraints, morphological constraints are ranked according to their importance in a language, with lower-ranked constraints being violated when necessary to satisfy higher-ranked constraints.\n"
"\n"
"Overall, both phonological and morphological constraints hold importance in the structure and pronunciation of words in a language under the framework of Optimality Theory. Their relative importance may depend on the linguistic context and specific properties of the language under analysis. It is essential to note, however, that Optimality Theory and its grounding on phonetic substance have been criticized by proponents of \"substance-free phonology,\" such as Mark Hale and Charles Reiss. These critics argue against the reliance on phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements like features, suggesting alternative ways to approach the study of phonology and morphology without assuming predetermined linguistic elements based on phonetic substance. Despite these criticisms, Optimality Theory remains a dominant trend in the study of phonology and morphology and sheds light on the importance of constraints and their relative ranking in the organization of linguistic systems."

"Felicia finds comfort and warmth in wearing a scarf, while Rebecca does not feel the need to wear one for various reasons. This difference in preference and perspective is shaped by their personal experiences, beliefs, and factors that influence their decision-making process in their everyday lives.\n"
"\n"
"Felicia's preference for wearing a scarf could stem from multiple reasons. One possible explanation may be that she has thin hair or is sensitive to changing temperatures, requiring her to wear a scarf to protect her ears and neck from the cold. Felicia might have also grown up in a family that places high importance on wearing scarves to protect against the cold or has cultural significance. In this case, Felicia's scarf becomes a symbol of care and a way to maintain her family traditions.\n"
"\n"
"On the other hand, Rebecca might not feel the need to wear a scarf due to personal comfort. She might find a scarf too restrictive or uncomfortable to wear or even prefer other winter accessories like earmuffs or turtleneck sweaters. Moreover, Rebecca might possess a thicker head of hair, which makes a scarf less essential. It is possible that Rebecca comes from a region where wearing a scarf is considered unnecessary due to warmer temperatures or different cultural practices.\n"
"\n"
"Another factor influencing their fashion choices could be their personal styles and aesthetics. Felicia might find that a scarf adds a touch of sophistication and elegance to her outfit, while Rebecca might consider her look complete without one. Felicia possibly enjoys experimenting with different types of scarves, experimenting with various folding techniques or patterns, highlighting her creativity and passion for fashion.\n"
"\n"
"Rebecca, in contrast, might lean towards minimalism when it comes to her wardrobe, appreciating the simplicity and ease of getting dressed without having to worry about coordinating her ensemble with a scarf. For Rebecca, her personal style reflects her preference for unencumbered aesthetics or functionality.\n"
"\n"
"Moreover, wearing or not wearing a scarf could also be influenced by their social circle, with friends encouraging each other's fashion choices or even participating in trends and challenges on social media. Felicia might have friends who love wearing scarves, encouraging her focus on following those trends, while Rebecca might be exposed to influencers on social media who promote a more simplistic approach to style. This friendly and subtle competition or camaraderie between Felicia and Rebecca can also contribute to what influences their decisions to wear specific accessories like a scarf.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, Felicia goes out wearing a scarf but Rebecca does not mainly because of the multitude of factors that shape their preferences, beliefs, and perspective on the matter. Personal experiences, upbringing, fashion sense, and individual tastes all play a role in their decisions on whether to incorporate a scarf into their daily wardrobe. The fact that they have differing opinions on wearing scarves showcases the diversity and individuality prevalent among humans. In all aspects of life, such differences should be celebrated, and we should appreciate everyone's unique choices, no matter how big or small those preferences may be."

"After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Roshanak in Bactrian) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent. He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now Pakistan, to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis(Indian name Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality. On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC. In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos. The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to Curtius, \"Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble\". A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days. \n"

"Martínez Falls Short, but Mets Stay in Place for Wild Card\n"
"Given Martínez’s postseason experience and lack of a valid alternative, it is almost inconceivable that the Mets would not pitch him should they need a fourth starter in a potential first-round series. But it will be challenging for Manuel to balance how Martínez has pitched with how the team fares during his starts. They have lost his last three, and the degree of culpability has diminished each time.\n"
"\n"
"He gave up six runs Sept. 7 against Philadelphia, four Monday night in Washington (when seven days’ rest affected the control of his breaking pitches) and followed up that performance Saturday by posting a nearly identical pitching line: nine hits, four runs (three in the first inning and one in the sixth), three walks and seven strikeouts. The Mets have scored six runs in those three starts.\n"
"\n"
"“I can’t say that losing his last three starts were all him,” Manuel said. He added: “I don’t know if we gotten off to good starts when he has pitched. It’s just one of those things that you run into every now and then.”\n"
"\n"
"Martínez said he did not want to use his difficult season as an excuse — his hamstring strain, his father’s death, his inconsistency — but he acknowledged that he has felt out of sync since rejoining the Mets after his father’s funeral in late July.\n"
"\n"
"“It’s really hard for me to be 100 percent and play baseball like I used to, just play baseball, hey, this is beautiful, healthy and all that,” Martínez said. “It’s very different than previous years. This year has been a hard year for me, a year with a lot of distractions and I haven’t really gained a lot from the game.”\n"
"\n"
"One trend that has followed Martínez all season is his first-inning struggles. Opponents entered Saturday hitting .347 with six homers off him in the first — compared with .278 with 12 homers the rest of the game — and have scored first-inning runs in each of his last four starts, including three runs on Saturday.\n"
"\n"
"“I can’t really pinpoint what’s going on, but maybe I’m not being as aggressive as I should sometimes,” said Martínez, before referring to his stretch in August of allowing first-inning homers. “I try to be aggressive, then gave up a couple of homers, it makes you wonder, it makes you start thinking, so you start to be a little more cautious. Thinking a bit too much, I think. Must be the reason. But without a doubt, I have to find out as soon as possible.”\n"
"\n"
"Martínez seems to get stronger, and better, as the game progresses. After giving up four hits in the first, he gave up one each in his next five. The final hit, a sixth-inning single by Josh Anderson, came after Manuel visited Martínez, his pitch count at 110. Martínez told Manuel he wanted to face him, and Anderson poked a changeup into right field to score Brandon Jones with the Braves’ fourth run.\n"
"\n"
"“What you hope for in the most part is the guy gives you a chance to win,” Manuel said. “I thought we had a chance with the game 3-2. We didn’t do much damage offensively, and that was that.”\n"

"The Latest Trump Tussle: Pope Francis on Trump's Christianity\n"
"\n"
"In a world where controversies make headlines, one name stands out - Donald Trump. The potential Republican nominee for the President of the United States has taken on numerous influential people and organizations over the past months. The back-and-forth exchanges between Trump and his rivals seem to be a never-ending parade of accusations, rebuttals, and goading. This time, it’s Pope Francis who has taken on the media mogul turned political powerhouse.\n"
"\n"
"On Thursday, while returning from his six-day visit to Mexico, Pope Francis was asked about Trump. Offering his thoughts on Trump's Christianity, he stated, \"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” the New York Times reported. This comment nodding at Trump's highly debated border-wall proposal, which involves the construction of a wall between Mexico and the U.S., with Mexico footing the bill.\n"
"\n"
"Despite providing criticism, Pope Francis did not explicitly encourage or discourage the American public from voting for Trump. He went on to say, \"I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that [about the wall]. We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.\"\n"
"\n"
"As expected from Trump's modus operandi, he did not stay silent for long. He fired back at the Pope's comments through Politico saying, \"For a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful. I am proud to be a Christian, and as president, I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened.\" Furthermore, Trump boldly challenged the Pope by saying that if ISIS ever attacked the Vatican, Pope Francis would wish he had been president because it would not have taken place, insinuating that Trump's handling of ISIS would be more effective than the current administration's strategies.\n"
"\n"
"Trump continued his rebuttal by suggesting that Mexico must have spoken disparagingly about him and roped Pope Francis into the conversation in an attempt to manipulate him as a \"pawn.\" Trump accused Mexico, saying \"they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them.\"\n"
"\n"
"Remaining true to form, Trump took advantage of the opportunity to address the matter publicly at a rally in South Carolina, where he reiterated his views and managed to slip in that \"I like the Pope.\"\n"
"\n"
"Simultaneously, in his news conference on the papal jet, Pope Francis offered his opinion on the use of contraception in relation to the Zika virus. The Pope clarified that Catholic women could use contraception to avoid complications due to the virus. However, he stood firm on the Church's outspoken stance against abortion, insisting that it remains completely off the table in such cases.\n"
"\n"
"In the midst of a heated political climate, this exchange between two influential figures on opposing ends of the spectrum raises questions, generates debates, and adds yet another headline-grabbing controversy to Trump's portfolio. How this impacts Trump's campaign remains to be seen, as well as whether or not he will continue confronting religious institutions in the future."

"Native Americans, also known as American Indians, Indians, Indigenous Americans and other terms, are the indigenous peoples of the United States. There are over 500 federally recognized tribes within the U.S., about half of which are associated with Indian reservations. The term excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaska Natives. The ancestors of modern Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago, possibly much earlier, from Asia via Beringia.\n"
"\n"
"After the Indian wars in the late 19th century, the government established Native American boarding schools, initially run primarily by or affiliated with Christian missionaries. At this time, American society thought that Native American children needed to be acculturated to the general society. The boarding school experience was a total immersion in modern American society, but it could prove traumatic to children, who were forbidden to speak their native languages. They were taught Christianity and not allowed to practice their native religions, and in numerous other ways forced to abandon their Native American identities.  Before the 1930s, schools on the reservations provided no schooling beyond the sixth grade. To obtain more, boarding school was usually necessary. Small reservations with a few hundred people usually sent their children to nearby public schools. The \"Indian New Deal\" of the 1930s closed many of the boarding schools, and downplayed the assimilationist goals. The Indian Division of the Civilian Conservation Corps operated large-scale construction projects on the reservations, building thousands of new schools and community buildings. Under the leadership of John Collier the BIA brought in progressive educators to reshape Indian education. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) by 1938 taught 30,000 students in 377 boarding and day schools, or 40% of all Indian children in school. The Navajo largely opposed schooling of any sort, but the other tribes accepted the system. There were now high schools on larger reservations, educating not only teenagers but also an adult audience. There were no Indian facilities for higher education. They deemphasized textbooks, emphasized self-esteem, and started teaching Indian history. They promoted traditional arts and crafts of the sort that could be conducted on the reservations, such as making jewelry. The New Deal reformers met significant resistance from parents and teachers, and had mixed results. World War II brought younger Indians in contact with the broader society through military service and work in the munitions industries. The role of schooling was changed to focus on vocational education for jobs in urban America.  Since the rise of self-determination for Native Americans, they have generally emphasized education of their children at schools near where they live. In addition, many federally recognized tribes have taken over operations of such schools and added programs of language retention and revival to strengthen their cultures. Beginning in the 1970s, tribes have also founded colleges at their reservations, controlled, and operated by Native Americans, to educate their young for jobs as well as to pass on their cultures.\n"

"Jack William Nicklaus (born January 21, 1940), nicknamed The Golden Bear, is an American retired professional golfer. He is widely regarded as the greatest golfer of all time, winning a record 18 career major championships, while producing 19 second-place and 9 third-place finishes, over a span of 25 years. Nicklaus focused on the major championships--Masters Tournament, U.S. Open, Open Championship and PGA Championship--and played a selective schedule of regular PGA Tour events, yet still finished with 73 victories, third on the all-time list behind Sam Snead (82) and Tiger Woods (79).\n"
"\n"
"In 1980, Nicklaus recorded only four top-10 finishes in 14 events, but two of these were record-setting victories in majors (the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship); the other two were a tie for fourth in The Open Championship and a runner-up finish in the Doral-Eastern Open to Raymond Floyd via his chip-in birdie on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff. These victories and placements more than justified the work Nicklaus put in toward his game during the off-season.  Nicklaus set a new scoring record for the 1980 U.S. Open with an aggregate of 272, eclipsing his earlier record of 275 from 1967 over the same golf course. That record, while since having been tied by three other players, stood until Rory McIlroy's 268 in winning the 2011 US Open. This was Nicklaus's second major win at Baltusrol Golf Club. Nicklaus opened with a record-tying 63 in round one and fought off his playing partner of all four rounds, 1978 Colgate World Match Play Championship winner, Isao Aoki. Entering the final round, Aoki had caught Nicklaus after three consecutive rounds of 68, but over the course of the last day, Nicklaus pulled away by two shots. Each player birdied the final two holes for a dramatic finish. Aoki's aggregate of 274 was the lowest score for a U.S. Open runner-up. Nicklaus' win was his fourth and final victory in the championship, tying him with Willie Anderson, Bobby Jones, and Ben Hogan. Nicklaus referred to this win as \"by far the most emotional and warmest reaction to any of my wins in my own country\".  In the 1980 PGA Championship, Nicklaus set another record in winning the championship by seven shots over Andy Bean at the Oak Hill Country Club, largely due to exceptional putting. Nicklaus shot an even-par 70 in the first round followed by three successive rounds in the 60s over the difficult course, and was the only player to break par for the 72 holes. For the week, the field averaged 74.60 strokes while Nicklaus averaged 68.50. This was Nicklaus' fifth and final victory in the PGA Championship, which elevated him to record-holder for the most wins in the stroke-play era, and which tied him with Walter Hagen for the most wins overall, since Hagen's victories were all during the match-play era. Nicklaus' seven-shot winning margin remained the largest for the stroke-play version of the championship until Rory's McIroy's 2012 victory. This victory also made Nicklaus the only player since Gene Sarazen in 1922 and Ben Hogan in 1948 to win the U.S. Open and PGA Championship the same year (subsequently equaled by Tiger Woods in 2000).\n"

"The impetuous young Kaiser, says John C. G. Rohl, rejected Bismarck's \"peaceful foreign policy\" and instead plotted with senior generals to work \"in favour of a war of aggression.\" Bismarck told an aide, \"That young man wants war with Russia, and would like to draw his sword straight away if he could. I shall not be a party to it.\" Bismarck, after gaining an absolute majority in favour of his policies in the Reichstag, decided to make the anti-Socialist laws permanent. His Kartell, the majority of the amalgamated Conservative Party and the National Liberal Party, favoured making the laws permanent, with one exception: the police power to expel Socialist agitators from their homes. The Kartell split over this issue and nothing was passed.  As the debate continued, Wilhelm became more and more interested in social problems, especially the treatment of mine workers who went on strike in 1889. He routinely interrupted Bismarck in Council to make clear where he stood on social policy. Bismarck sharply disagreed with Wilhelm's policy and worked to circumvent it.  Bismarck, feeling pressured and unappreciated by the young Emperor and undermined by his ambitious advisors, refused to sign a proclamation regarding the protection of workers along with Wilhelm, as was required by the German Constitution. The final break came as Bismarck searched for a new parliamentary majority, with his Kartell voted from power due to the anti-Socialist bill fiasco. The remaining powers in the Reichstag were the Catholic Centre Party and the Conservative Party. Bismarck wished to form a new bloc with the Centre Party, and invited Ludwig Windthorst, the party's parliamentary leader, to discuss a coalition. Wilhelm was furious to hear about Windthorst's visit. In a parliamentary state, the head of government depends on the confidence of the parliamentary majority and has the right to form coalitions to ensure his policies a majority, but in Germany, the Chancellor had to depend on the confidence of the Emperor, and Wilhelm believed that the Emperor had the right to be informed before his ministers' meeting. After a heated argument at Bismarck's estate over Imperial authority, Wilhelm stormed out. Bismarck, forced for the first time into a situation he could not use to his advantage, wrote a blistering letter of resignation, decrying Wilhelm's interference in foreign and domestic policy, which was published only after Bismarck's death.  Although Bismarck had sponsored landmark social security legislation, by 1889-90, he had become disillusioned with the attitude of workers. In particular, he was opposed to wage increases, improving working conditions, and regulating labour relations. Moreover, the Kartell, the shifting political coalition that Bismarck had been able to forge since 1867, had lost a working majority in the Reichstag. At the opening of the Reichstag on 6 May 1890, the Kaiser stated that the most pressing issue was the further enlargement of the bill concerning the protection of the labourer. In 1891, the Reichstag passed the Workers Protection Acts, which improved working conditions, protected women and children and regulated labour relations.\n"

"Ruth Etting (November 23, 1897 - September 24, 1978) was an American singing star and actress of the 1920s and 1930s, who had over 60 hit recordings and worked in stage, radio, and film. Known as \"America's sweetheart of song\", her signature tunes were \"Shine On, Harvest Moon\", \"Ten Cents a Dance\" and \"Love Me or Leave Me\". Her other popular recordings included \"Button Up Your Overcoat\", \"Mean to Me\", \"Exactly Like You\" and \"Shaking the Blues Away\". As a young girl in Nebraska, Etting had wanted to be an artist; she drew and sketched everywhere she was able.\n"

"Etting fell in love with her pianist, Myrl Alderman, who was separated from his wife. In January 1938, she began receiving threatening telephone calls from Snyder, who initially claimed Etting withheld assets from him when the divorce settlement was made. Though the couple was divorced, Snyder was also upset because of reports that she was seeing another man. Snyder told Etting that he would come to California and kill her. When Snyder telephoned and found Etting unavailable, he told his daughter Edith that he \"would fix her ticket, too\". He called again that evening; this time Etting took the call with her cousin, Arthur Etting, listening on an extension. Etting requested police protection after the telephone call and arranged for private protection. Apparently believing the danger was over when Snyder did not appear soon after his telephone call, Etting released her bodyguards a few days later.  On October 15, 1938, Snyder detained Myrl Alderman at a local radio station and forced the pianist to take him to his former wife at gunpoint. In the house at the time were Etting and Edith Snyder. Edith, Snyder's daughter by a previous marriage, worked for Etting and remained living with her after the divorce. Snyder held Etting and Alderman at gunpoint; when told his daughter was in another part of the house, he made Etting call her into the room. Snyder said he intended to kill all three, and told them to be quiet. When Myrl Alderman attempted to speak, Snyder shot him. Snyder then told his ex-wife, \"I've had my revenge, so you can call the police.\"  Snyder claimed Myrl Alderman pulled a gun and shot at him first and that his ex-wife would not file charges against him because she still loved him. He also claimed he was drunk when he made the telephone threats to Etting in January 1938, saying that at the time his intentions were to kill both his ex-wife and himself. Ruth Etting said that the only gun in the home belonged to her, and after the shooting of Alderman, she was able to go into her bedroom and get it. Upon seeing Etting's gun, Moe Snyder wrested it away from her; it landed on the floor. Snyder's daughter, Edith, picked it up and held it on her father, shooting at him but hitting the floor instead. During a police reenactment of the shooting three days later, Edith Snyder said that she fired at her father to save Ruth Etting, weeping as she continued, \"I don't yet know whether I am sorry I missed my Dad or whether I am glad\". Snyder was accused of attempting to murder his ex-wife, his daughter, and Etting's accompanist, Myrl Alderman, the kidnapping of Alderman, as well as California state gun law violations.\n"

"By. Louise Boyle. PUBLISHED:. 11:51 EST, 25 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 13:39 EST, 25 September 2013. A state house staffer who left his loaded handgun in the men's bathroom at the Capitol building is facing calls for his resignation. Dave Evans, a legislative assistant. to Republican House Speaker Tim Jones, left the loaded 9mm pistol on top of a. toilet paper dispenser in a men’s bathroom in the Missouri State Capitol. last Friday. Another House staffer found the gun and reported it to police. A gun safety group today called for Evans to be fired after he left the gun in the basement bathroom in Jefferson City, Missouri. Danger: Dave Evans (left), a legislative assistant to House Speaker Tim Jones (pictured right), left a loaded handgun in a bathroom at the State Capitol building in Missouri on Friday. A gun safety group is calling for a Missouri House staffer to be fired after he left a loaded handgun unattended in a Capitol bathroom in Jefferson Ci. Rebecca Morgan, spokeswoman for the Missouri chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said: 'Any child could’ve found that gun, or someone could’ve found it and resold it.' According to the police report, Evans has a concealed-carry permit. Police returned the gun to him, and no charges were filed. A 2011 law allows legislative staff with concealed-carry permits to bring firearms into the Capitol. Tom Smith, Jones’ chief of staff, said in a statement on Tuesday that Evans will take a gun safety course in the next few weeks as a result of the incident. 'He is extremely remorseful about this unfortunate incident and willing to take full accountability for his mistake,' Mr Smith said. Ms Morgan said the Missouri chapter of Moms Demand Action has asked Jones to issue an apology and to fire Evans. The. organization is also calling schools and asking them to cancel their. planned field trips to the Capitol, which houses the Missouri State. Museum. Dave Evans, left a Kahr CM9 9 mm gun, in a public bathroom stall at the Capitol building in Missouri (stock image) The museum received more than 470,000 visitors last year, according to its website. Of those, 30,000 were children on guided tours, according to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. Morgan said that just as mothers call their children’s friends’ houses before play dates to make sure all firearms are secured, parents and schools should be aware of safety risks within the Capitol building. 'My son is supposed to go later in the school year, and I don’t feel safe sending him to the Capitol,' she said. The Moms Demand Action group hopes its effort will help change the 2011 concealed-carry law. 'If (Evans) can have his fully loaded, ready-to-shoot, unattended gun in a restroom and there’s no law against it, the law needs to change,' Morgan said. She said the organization received no direct response from the Capitol. Moms Demand Action describes itself as a grassroots organization that formed nationwide after the December 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. 'It’s just a crying shame,' Morgan said of the unattended gun. 'It’s our responsibility as parents and as legislators to make sure that it doesn’t take losing a child’s life to change this law.'\n"

Searching for solace and a new life, Frank moves to a small town nestled in the mountains, hoping the isolation would help him heal. However, he comes to the jarring realization that the town is under the malicious control of a corrupt police chief, Jonas Ritter, and his powerful gang of enforcers who engage in human trafficking, drug smuggling, and racketeering operations. \n"
"\n"
"Frank Mitchell (played by a seasoned action star, such as Tom Hardy or Keanu Reeves) discovers that Ritter and his gang have been coercing vulnerable town occupants into joining their criminal enterprise. A concerned Frank befriends the widowed owner of a local diner, May Anderson, and her teenage daughter, Emily (a possible role for a promising young actress). While Frank keeps his past a secret, May shares with him how her late husband, Ben, died mysteriously while attempting to expose Chief Ritter and his gang's crimes.\n"

"Input: Outgoing Gov. Chris Christie  said Tuesday that New Jersey needed \"tough and plain-spoken leadership\" when  he  took office eight years ago and  he  delivered it  pulling the state from \"the brink of financial ruin\" by confronting problems leaders of both parties had ignored for decades.\n"
" Christie  hands over state government to Democrat Phil Murphy in a week.\n"
" Christie  said  he  was the first governor in America to try to tackle the huge and escalating burden of state pension costs  saying previous governors from both parties and Legislatures \"virtually ignored the growing menace of increased costs and no real contributions.\" Among the steps taken during  his  administration was dedicating lottery proceeds to the pension system for the next 30 years.\n"
"When  he  took office   Christie  said  New Jersey was \"on the brink of financial ruin as a state.\"\n"
"\"We needed tough and plain-spoken leadership to deal with these problems \"  he  said.\n"
" He  said  he  vetoed more than $7 billion in spending  helped cut the state workforce  pushed through a cap on property tax increases and  at the same time  made sure the state invested heavily to help protect the New Jersey Shore from the kind of devastation it suffered during Superstorm Sandy in 2012.\n"
"The prepared text of  his  remarks didn't show  him  invoking the name of  his  friend  President Donald Trump. But  he  called it an \"honor\" to chair the White House's opioid commission.\n"
" Christie 's speech caps  his  stint as one of America's best-known governors.\n"
" He  was on the cover of Time magazine under the headline \"The Boss\" and a periodic guest on late-night television  where  he  memorably appeared in a skit about \"dad dancing\" with Jimmy Fallon and poked fun at  his  weight by eating a doughnut on David Letterman's show.\n"
"At least in the beginning   he  won acclaim for  his  forthrightness  like when  he  told beachcombers to \"get the hell off the beach\" in 2011 during Hurricane Irene.  He  told it like it was before Trump brought the practice to the White House.\n"
" He  also was exceedingly popular and widely praised for guiding the state in its recovery from Superstorm Sandy  which ravaged the coastline.  He  was briefly seen as a top GOP contender for president.\n"
"But  he  was also criticized for testy exchanges with the public during town hall meetings and other encounters.\n"
" His  popularity and job approval fell sharply  particularly after the George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal in which three of  his  allies were convicted in a political retribution scheme.  He  also lost the home crowd after spending much of 2015 and early 2016 campaigning for president out of state  a contest  he  dropped out of after failing to emerge from the back of the pack.\n"
" He  returned to New Jersey and focused on the state's â and country's â opioid addiction crisis after failing to get a top job in the Trump administration. A regular theme in  his  remarks around the state included \"second chances \" and the idea that people can make a comeback.\n"

"Until recently, my father's sister lived in a dangerous and unstable country (I won't go into specifics, but it is somewhere in Africa), however she is still a citizen of our home country and due to the instability, my father offered to get her on a plane house her until she is on her feet. She is nearing retirement age, she has no saving and she cannot drive, and we live in a rural community where work in the local area is scarce. Also important is that I have not seen her or even spoken to her in over 20 years and my fiancée has never met her. \n"
"\n"
"My fiancée and I have been together for approximately 5 years but only moved in together about a year ago. Our house is a very small 2 bed, although the 2nd room is barely more than a box room - it's fine for the two of us, but it gets cramped if we have anyone round. Financially we are comfortable, but we are by no means well off. We're also getting married later this year and plan to start trying for a baby immediately after that. This is all important context. \n"
"\n"
"My father is emigrating later this year, and on christmas day he took me to one side and put me on the spot; if his sister is not on her feet by the time he moves, will we take her in? I was taken aback but I did not give him an answer either way as I was not willing to commit without my fiancé's input. Shortly afterwards however, we returned to the lounge and my father phoned another member of family and, in front of my completely oblivious fiancée, informed them that we'd be happy to take in his sister. My fiancée was gobsmacked but said nothing. After we left however, she erupted and we had a major row - again, on christmas day. Because of the way she found out, she thought I was in on these plans and had agreed to all of this behind her back, and though I eventually convinced her that I was as much in the dark on this as she was, it nevertheless ruined our christmas.\n"
"\n"
"After calming down, we sat and talked and decided that we would not take her in. Housing her would compromise our privacy, it would potentially hamper our future plans re: trying for a baby, and  we are simply not in a position financially support a third adult right now. A few days later we went to my father's house to tell him this, however he became very angry and told us to get out. Since then, I have barely spoken to him, and on the few instances that I have, the atmosphere between us has been noticeably different. I understand the reasons for her leaving the country she was in, but I feel as though my father took it for granted that my fiancée and I, who are just starting our own lives together, would step up to the plate to support her whilst he moves to another country to start a new life for himself. As terrible as I feel for her, it's not a burden that we are in a position to take on, even if she is family.\n"

"Based on the premise, \"Behavioral risk factors in emergency department: a multisite survey,\" it is difficult to definitively conclude if the hypothesis \"The multisite survey is going to be the first of many attempts to research the matter more thoroughly\" is true without further information. However, it can be inferred that the study aims to explore the behavioral risk factors in emergency departments across multiple locations, which implies a desire to investigate the topic comprehensively.\n"
"\n"
"Multisite surveys hold numerous advantages over single-site studies, especially when it concerns global or regional issues. By conducting research across various sites, researchers are able to:\n"
"\n"
"1. Collect a larger and diverse sample size: By selecting different locations, the study benefits from a broader range of participants, making the findings more generalizable to wider populations.\n"
"\n"
"2. Control for site-specific biases: Some locations may have unique characteristics that influence study outcomes, making it difficult to determine if the results can be applied elsewhere. In multisite surveys, researchers can identify such biases and adjust their analysis accordingly.\n"
"\n"
"3. Improve reliability and validity: If similar findings emerge from different locations, it strengthens the reliability and validity of the study. This multisite approach bolsters the argument that the observed effects are not merely a result of site-specific factors but reflect a more widespread pattern.\n"
"\n"
"Given these advantages, it can be inferred that the researchers behind the study, \"Behavioral risk factors in emergency department: a multisite survey,\" are keen on conducting an in-depth investigation into the topic. While their multisite approach provides valuable insights, it is difficult to predict if this will be the first of many attempts to research the matter more thoroughly. This hypothesis could be better supported if more information were available, such as:\n"
"\n"
"- The researchers' stated goals or objectives: If the researchers explicitly mentioned their long-term intentions to explore the topic further, it would support the hypothesis directly.\n"
"\n"
"- Previous research in this field: If this multisite survey fills a gap in existing literature, it might spark further interest and lead to additional research.\n"
"\n"
"- Follow-up studies or data collection: If the researchers propose follow-up studies or plan to monitor the participants for an extended period, it would indicate a commitment to expanding their research efforts.\n"
"\n"
"- Interest and investment in the field: If notable organizations or institutions show interest and invest resources in this area, it signifies a growing commitment to thoroughly understanding behavioral risk factors in emergency departments.\n"
"\n"
"In summary, while the premise demonstrates that the researchers are committed to investigating the issue of behavioral risk factors in emergency departments across multiple locations, it cannot be definitively concluded that this study will be the first of many attempts to explore this matter more thoroughly without additional information.

"Elena had been living there for the past five years. Elena happily agreed to share her knowledge and experience with her friend.\n"
"\n"
"Elena started by explaining the cultural norms and etiquette in Japan to Felicia. She emphasized the importance of being polite and respectful as these are highly valued traits in Japanese society. \"In Japan,\" Elena said, \"it's crucial to show respect to others in your actions and speech. It's simple actions like bowing when you meet someone, saying 'itoashimasu’ before starting a meal, and ‘gochisosama deshita’ at the end of a meal, or thankfully accepting change with both hands at a store that can make a huge difference in how you're perceived. Using honorific titles like 'san', 'kun', or 'sama' after someone's name is also important. It indicates respect and acknowledgment.\"\n"
"\n"
"Next, Elena emphasized the role of intricate customs tied to specific situations. For instance, she mentioned the tradition of taking one's shoes off before entering a home or certain traditional establishments. \"You'll notice a change in the floor level,\" she explained, \"That's your cue to remove your shoes. And remember to wear nice socks as your feet may be exposed!\" She also talked about the bathhouse etiquette which includes washing thoroughly before entering the onsen and avoiding the use of mobile phones or loud conversations that could disrupt the serenity.\n"
"\n"
"Elena also talked about punctuality, stating that it is highly prized in Japan. \"Trains, meetings, appointments—all follow a strict timeline,\" she said, \"Being late is seen as a lack of respect for others' time. Always plan to arrive at least ten minutes ahead of schedule—just to be safe.\"\n"
"\n"
"She then moved on to discuss the societal norms. \"Don't stick your chopsticks straight into a bowl of rice,\" warned Elena, \"This is something you do at a funeral and is considered very disrespectful if done casually. Also, avoid blowing your nose in public. It's seen as a private act and could earn you some odd stares.\" \n"
"\n"
"Elena also advised Felicia on clothing standards. According to Elena, the Japanese prefer a more conservative dressing style. \"Avoid revealing clothes,\" she said, \"Especially in religious locations like temples.\"\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, Elena advised Felicia on the importance of understanding the language, even if it's just basic conversational phrases or greetings. Although English is taught in schools, not every Japanese will be fluent or confident in it. \"Knowing even basic phrases like 'Sumimasen' (excuse me), 'Arigatō gozaimasu' (thank you), 'Ohayō gozaimasu' (good morning), 'Konbanwa' (good evening) can be extremely helpful,\" said Elena. \"Also, if you can, learn to read the two primary alphabets, Hiragana and Katakana. Many key signs, menus, and directions are written in these scripts.\"\n"
"\n"
"Elena concluded her advice by wishing Felicia an enriching trip, \"Japan is a beautiful country, Felicia, with a deep, complex, and fascinating culture. It may seem a bit daunting at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll begin to appreciate the subtleties even more. Remember, it's all about respect, politeness, empathy, and understanding.\"\n"
"\n"
"Felicia thanked Elena for her valuable advice and felt much more prepared and excited about her upcoming journey to Japan."

"Question: A coffee shop brews 10 coffee cups per hour on a weekday and 120 coffee cups in total over the weekend. If the coffee shop is open 5 hours a day every single day, how many coffee cups are brewed in 1 week?\n"
"Answer: On a weekday, the shop produces 10 coffee cups per hour * 5 hours per weekday = 50 coffee cups. The coffee shop therefore brewed 50 coffee cups per day * 5 weekdays in a week = 250 coffee cups. So in total, the coffee shop brewed a total of 250 weekday coffee cups + 120 weekend coffee cups = 370 coffee cups in 1 week. The answer is 370.\n"
"[Question]Jenny is planning her catering budget for her wedding. She's going to have 80 guests. 3 times as many guests want steak as chicken. If each steak entree costs $25 and each chicken entree costs $18, how much is the total catering budget?\n"
"[Answer]Let s be the number of guests who want steak and c be the number who want chicken. We know that s + c = 80 and s = 3c. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 3c + c = 80. Combining like terms, we get 4c = 80. Dividing both sides by 4, we get c = 20. Then multiply the number of guests who want chicken by the cost of each chicken entree: 20 guests * $18 / guest = $360. Then triple the number of guests who want chicken to find the number who want steak: 20 guests * 3 = 60 guests. Then multiply the number of guests who want steak by the cost of each steak entree: 60 guests * $25 / guest = $1500. Then add the cost of the steak and chicken entrees to find the total cost: $1500 + $360 = $1860. The answer is 1860.\n"
"Q: Karen had the giant box of crayons, containing twice as many crayons as were in Beatrice's box. But Beatrice's box contained twice as many crayons as were in Gilbert's box of crayons. And Gilbert had four times as many crayons as were in Judah's box of crayons. If Karen's box contained 128 crayons, how many crayons were in Judah's box?\n"
"A: If Karen's 128 crayons were twice as many as were in Beatrice's box, there were 128 / 2 = 64 crayons in Beatrice's box. And since Beatrice's box contained twice as many crayons as were in Gilbert's box of crayons, then Gilbert had 64 / 2 = 32 crayons. And since Gilbert had four times as many crayons as Judah, then Judah had 32 / 4 = 8 crayons. The answer is 8.\n"
"Question: Monroe made 200 granola bars for her family. She and her husband ate 80, and the rest was divided equally among her children. If each child received 20 granola bars, how many children are in the family?\n"
"Answer: If Monroe and her husband ate 80 granola bars, then the number of granola bars the children shared is 200 - 80 = 120. Each child received 20 bars, and there were 120 granola bars, meaning there were 120 / 20 = 6 children in the family. The answer is 6.\n"
"[Question]Eric has 20 marbles. He has 12 white marbles, 6 blue marbles, and the rest are green marbles. How many green marbles does Eric have?\n"
"[Answer]Eric has a total of 12 + 6 = 18 white and blue marbles. Thus, he has 20 - 18 = 2 green marbles. The answer is 2.\n"
"[Question]Several birds were sitting in the branches of a crape myrtle tree. There were three times more cardinals than bluebirds, but half as many swallows as bluebirds. If there were 2 swallows, what is the total number of birds in the crape myrtle tree?\n"

"Why are few people born transgender?\n"
"\n"
"Transgender people are individuals whose gender identity (the internal sense of being male, female, or nonbinary) does not correspond with their assigned gender at birth (based on their biological sex). While the exact number of transgender people is difficult to estimate, it is generally considered a small percentage of the overall population. Various studies estimate that transgender people make up somewhere between 0.3% and 1.2% of the population, depending on the country and methodology.\n"
"\n"
"There isn't a specific reason why there are relatively fewer transgender individuals than cisgender (those whose gender identity corresponds with their assigned gender at birth) individuals. Research is still ongoing to understand the underlying factors that contribute to someone being transgender.\n"
"\n"
"Some studies suggest that genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors may play roles in the development of gender identity. For example, exposure to certain hormones before birth may influence brain development, resulting in a person's gender identity not aligning with their biological sex. Additionally, certain studies have found that there might be some genetic factors that contribute to being transgender, although these findings are still not definitive and require more research.\n"
"\n"
"How are transgender people born?\n"
"\n"
"While the precise cause of someone being transgender remains uncertain, evidence points to a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors that can contribute to this incongruity between a person's assigned gender at birth and their gender identity.\n"
"\n"
"One theory involves prenatal exposure to certain hormones, particularly testosterone, during critical periods of brain development. This theory suggests that abnormal hormone exposure may result in transgender individuals developing a brain that is more similar to the opposite sex, leading to a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity.\n"
"\n"
"Genetics may also play a role in being transgender. Research has identified specific genes that might be associated with transgender individuals, although it is important to remember that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, and further research is necessary to determine the relationship between these genes and being transgender.\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, environmental factors may also contribute to being transgender. Some studies have found higher prevalence rates of transgender individuals among first-borns and fraternal twins, which might suggest an effect of the prenatal environment.\n"
"\n"
"In summary, while the two questions you posed are closely related, they do not have the same meaning. The first question asks about the relatively small percentage of transgender people, while the second question focuses on the factors contributing to the development of transgender individuals. The answers provided suggest that a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors may play a role in the development of someone's gender identity, but more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms fully."
