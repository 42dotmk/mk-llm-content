"Laura thrives on conflict while Christine avoids it, so when faced with challenging situations, their individual approaches to problem-solving can lead to either highly productive collaboration or unintended friction between the two.\n"
"\n"
"Laura's penchant for conflict means she will actively seek out opportunities to engage in debates and discussions as a means to better understand a given situation or issue. She is not afraid to confront others in order to ensure both her viewpoint and the viewpoints of those she represents are clearly articulated and considered. This unyielding determination can foster an atmosphere of healthy debate that can lead to creative problem-solving, ultimately benefiting the team or organization as a whole.\n"
"\n"
"Christine, on the other hand, prefers to avoid conflict at all costs, choosing instead to seek out solutions through collaboration and working together with others. She believes that finding common ground and discovering the most effective means of accomplishing a goal can be achieved through positive interactions and open communication, without the need for a combative approach. Christine's preference is to remove the adversarial aspect of conflict in favor of fostering an environment of support and understanding, which she feels is a more effective means of achieving meaningful results.\n"
"\n"
"Despite their contrasting problem-solving styles, both Laura and Christine can find a way to make their unique approaches work for the benefit of their team or organization, if they are willing to take the time to understand and appreciate the value each of them brings. By recognizing the importance of both perspectives, and learning how to effectively harness their individual strengths while mitigating potential areas of discord, Laura and Christine can create a powerful dynamic that may initially appear counterintuitive, but has the potential to yield highly successful outcomes.\n"
"\n"
"In order to build a successful working relationship, both Laura and Christine will need to be open to embracing the diversity of their approaches in addressing challenges and problem-solving. It may involve committing to a series of candid conversations and self-reflective exercises that allow them to delve into the root causes of their individual preferences, and determine opportunities for compromise.\n"
"\n"
"For example, they can agree upon certain ground rules when faced with a pressing issue or complex project, wherein Laura is allowed the opportunity to express her thoughts and opinions through a more confrontational format, while Christine is given the chance to create a separate space for collaborative discussions and brainstorming sessions. By respecting each other's boundaries, they can create a healthy balance between engaging in conflict when necessary while still maintaining an environment that fosters cooperation and teamwork.\n"
"\n"
"Ultimately, it is through acknowledging and respecting the differences between their individual conflict management styles, that Laura and Christine can truly leverage their unique strengths and achieve a level of successful collaboration that both satisfies their individual needs and promotes the success of their team or organization as a whole."

"The data provided pertains to a comprehensive list and specific information related to the monsters and creatures found in the popular role-playing game (RPG), Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), specifically between the years 1977 and 1999. Dungeons & Dragons is a tabletop RPG that allows players to create their own characters, embark on adventures, and engage in battles within a fantasy world. The game masters (also known as Dungeon Masters or DMs) are responsible for controlling and describing the world, providing challenges, and managing the story, which often includes a menagerie of monsters and creatures.\n"
"\n"
"The provided data specifically refers to Elemental creatures, which are a particular type of monster in the D&D universe. These creatures originate from the elemental planes, which are the foundational building blocks of the universe. Elementals can be comprised of many forms, most commonly embodying either earth, air, fire, or water. Some elementals can also arise from more obscure elements or combinations thereof. Elemental creatures can possess varying strengths and abilities depending on their elemental affinity.\n"
"\n"
"Within the detailed data, the mention of 'D&D Expert Rules (1981)' and 'D&D Expert Rules (1983)' hints at the appearance of Elemental creatures within these two rulebooks. It is likely that the authors of these rulebooks laid out essential guidelines on how to incorporate Elemental creatures into the game, such as their unique abilities, hit points, and game statistics. This information enables game masters to present engaging challenges to players when they encounter Elementals during play.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, the data lists the 'Rules Cyclopedia (1991)' as another source containing Elemental creatures. The Rules Cyclopedia is a comprehensive compilation of the D&D Basic, Expert, Companion, and Master rules that were released during the game's early edition years, consolidating them into a single tome. It covers information on how to create characters, how to play the game, and what creatures players may encounter. The inclusion of Elemental creatures in this sourcebook confirms their importance within the D&D universe as iconic and easily recognizable adversaries players might face in their adventures.\n"
"\n"
"The data also classifies Elementals as 'CREATURE_(OTHER_PLANES)', a label that further emphasizes the creature's origin. The term 'OTHER_PLANES' refers to the various planes of existence that exist within the multiverse of D&D; in the context of Elemental creatures, this indicates their connection to the elemental planes from which they hail. This distinction sets Elementals apart from other monster types that emerge from different planes, each with unique traits and characteristics.\n"
"\n"
"Overall, the given data highlights a list of Dungeons & Dragons monsters from 1977 to 1999, with a particular focus on Elemental creatures. These creatures inhabit the otherworldly planes associated with the game's core elements and have appeared in various rulebooks and source materials throughout the game's history. They provide challenges and interesting game mechanics to players and game masters alike, solidifying their role as iconic inhabitants of the expansive D&D universe."

"Question: Louis is making himself a velvet suit for a formal event. The velvet fabric he chose was $24 per yard. He bought a pattern for $15, and two spools of silver thread for $3 each. If he spent $141 for the pattern, thread, and fabric, how many yards of fabric did he buy?\n"
"Answer: Let V be the number of yards of velvet fabric Louis bought. The silver thread cost 2 * 3 = $6. He spent 24V + 15 + 6 = $141 on the suit. The fabric cost 24V = 141 - 15 - 6 = $120. Thus, Louis bought V = 120 / 24 = 5 yards of fabric. The answer is 5.\n"
"[Question]John had $20. He spent 1/5 of his money on snacks and 3/4 of the remaining money on necessities. How much is left of John's money?\n"
"[Answer]John spent $20 x 1 / 5 = $4 on snacks. He had $20 - $4 = $16 remaining. He spent $16 x 3 / 4 = $12 on his necessities. So, John is left with $16 - $12 = $4. The answer is 4.\n"
"Q: There are four times as many boys at Lulu's party as girls. Each boy paid twice the money that each girl paid to attend the party. If there are 40 boys at the party and each boy paid $50 to attend the party, calculate the total amount of money collected at the party.\n"
"A: The total amount of money collected from the boy's payment is 40 * $50 = $2000. There are four times as many boys at Lulu's party as girls, meaning there are 40 / 4 = 10 girls at the party. since each boy paid twice the money that each girl paid to attend the party, each girl paid $50 / 2 = $25. The total amount of money collected from the girl's payment is $25 * 10 = $250. The total amount of money collected at the party is $250 + $2000 = $2250. The answer is 2250.\n"
"Question: A married couple opened a savings account. The wife committed to saving $100 every week while the husband committed to saving $225 every month. After 4 months of savings, they decided to invest half of their money in buying stocks. Each share of stocks costs $50. How many shares of stocks can they buy?\n"
"Answer: The wife saves $100 / week x 4 weeks / month = $400 a month. Together, the wife and husband save $400 / month + $225 / month = $625 / month. In 4 months, their total savings is $625 / month x 4 months = $2500. They are going to invest $2500 / 2 = $1250. So, they can buy $1250 / $50 / share = 25 shares of stocks. The answer is 25.\n"
"[Question]Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?\n"
"[Answer]Alice folds 1000 * 0.5 = 500 paper cranes by herself. This leaves 1000 – 500 = 500 paper cranes left to fold. A friend folds a fifth of the remaining amount, so they have folded 500 / 5 = 100 paper cranes for her. This means there is a total of 1000 – 500 – 100 = 400 paper cranes left for Alice to fold. The answer is 400.\n"
"[Question]Alina and her best friend Lucia like to chat a lot. On a particular day, Alina sent 20 fewer messages than her friend Lucia, who sent 120 messages.

"Answer by taking a quote from the following article:\n"
"\n"
"Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr. was born in Quincy, Illinois, on 23 February 1915, the son of Paul Warfield Tibbets Sr. and his wife, Enola Gay Tibbets. When he was five years old the family moved to Davenport, Iowa, and then to Iowa's capital, Des Moines, where he was raised, and where his father became a confections wholesaler. When he was eight, his family moved to Hialeah, Florida, to escape from harsh midwestern winters. As a boy he was very interested in flying.\n"
"\n"
"The 509th Composite Group returned to the United States on 6 November 1945, and was stationed at Roswell Army Airfield, New Mexico. Colonel William H. Blanchard replaced Tibbets as group commander on 22 January 1946, and also became the first commander of the 509th Bombardment Wing, the successor to the 509th Composite Group. Tibbets was a technical advisor to the 1946 Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, but he and his Enola Gay crew were not chosen to drop another atomic bomb.  Tibbets then attended the Air Command and Staff School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. On graduating in 1947 he was posted to the Directorate of Requirements at Air Force Headquarters at the Pentagon. When the head of the directorate, Brigadier General Thomas S. Power, was posted to London as air attache, he was replaced by Brigadier General Carl Brandt. Brandt appointed Tibbets as director of Directorate of Requirements's Strategic Air Division, which was responsible for drawing up requirements for future bombers. Tibbets was convinced that the bombers of the future would be jet aircraft and thus became involved in the Boeing B-47 Stratojet program. He subsequently served as B-47 project officer at Boeing in Wichita from July 1950 until February 1952. He then became commander of the Proof Test Division at Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso, Florida, where flight testing of the B-47 was conducted.  Tibbets returned to Maxwell Air Force Base, where he attended the Air War College. After he graduated in June 1955, he became Director of War Plans at the Allied Air Forces in Central Europe Headquarters at Fontainebleau, France. He left Lucy and his sons behind in Alabama, and he and Lucy divorced that year. During his posting to France, he met a French divorcee named Andrea Quattrehomme, who became his second wife. He returned to the United States in February 1956 to command the 308th Bombardment Wing at Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia, and married her in the base chapel on 4 May 1956. They had a son, James Tibbets.  In January 1958, Tibbets became commander of the 6th Air Division at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. and was promoted to brigadier general in 1959. This was followed by another tour of duty at the Pentagon as director of Management Analysis. In July 1962, he was assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff as deputy director for operations, and then, in June 1963, as deputy director for the National Military Command System. In 1964, Tibbets was named military attache in India. He spent 22 months there on this posting, which ended in June 1966. He retired from the United States Air Force (USAF) on 31 August 1966.\n"

"After a long and exciting summer of working at Cedar Point, Kelly's memorable experience of finding that $20 bill lingered in her mind. She often wondered what could have happened to the person who had lost it as she immediately reported it to the security booth, still feeling the fluttering excitement that came with such a discovery. However, the week went by incredibly quickly, with the hustle and bustle of her job in the amusement park keeping her fairly occupied, and her regular interactions with enthusiastic visitors allowed for very little time to think.\n"
"\n"
"Despite this, she couldn't shake the curiosity that loomed over the unclaimed cash. A week had passed since that fateful day, with the memory of the money she had found still etched in her mind. Kelly's brief breaks in between shifts were mostly spent pondering about the owner of the $20 bill. The more she thought about it, the more she realized it could have belonged to anyone – a thrill-seeking teenager enjoying the roller coasters, a patient parent waiting in line for their child's favorite ride, or even a zealous employee grabbing a snack between shifts.\n"
"\n"
"As the end of her summer job approached, Kelly made sure to casually inquire the security guards about the still unclaimed $20. The guards, being diligent in performing their duties, admitted that they had no luck in finding the owner, and it seemed somewhat bleak that it would ever be found. After discussing the situation with her supervisor, she was advised that the money could be returned to her, as the standard lost-and-found waiting period had expired, and no rightful owner had come forth to claim it despite their best efforts.\n"
"\n"
"With the extra $20 in her possession, Kelly now had an unexpected decision to make – how to spend her newly acquired money. She weighed her options carefully, considering not only her own desires and preferences but also the potential good deeds she could accomplish with the modest sum. Ultimately, Kelly decided that the mystery surrounding the $20 bill could be channeled into something positive, and she would use the money to celebrate her growing bond with her new work friends and the unforgettable memories that had been created over the summer.\n"
"\n"
"In an act of kindness and camaraderie, she pooled her newfound cash with some of her own savings and organized a small farewell celebration for her fellow employees at Cedar Point. It was a jovial and bittersweet event, filled with laughter, heartfelt farewells, and of course, delicious treats. At the end of the evening, Kelly handed out small souvenirs and token bags of candies for everyone in attendance, mentioning the story of the $20 bill as a reminder of the incredible and unpredictable adventures they had shared together at the amusement park.\n"
"\n"
"Though the money she found eventually was returned to her, the real treasure that Kelly took away from Cedar Point that summer was the cherished friendships and countless memories that were etched in her heart. Together with her new friends, they reminisced about their Cedar Point adventure, and the lost $20 bill ceased to be an enigma, but rather a symbol of fortuitous circumstances and the generosity that we all hold within ourselves."

"The family of a Russian heavyweight boxer who was beaten into a coma last year has filed a $100 million negligence lawsuit against the state of New York. Magomed Abdusalamov, 32, suffered a stroke and languished in a coma for several weeks after his vicious November 2 fight against Cuba's Mike Perez at Madison Square Garden. He is now bedridden with fears he may never walk or talk again. Now the fighter’s devastated wife Bakanay Abdusalamova plans to sue the state of New York and its athletic commission, alleging negligence and medical malpractice. She claimed in court papers filed yesterday that officials allowed her husband to be 'violently beaten, bludgeoned, punched and pummeled by his opponent without proper, timely or adequate recognition, termination and or/rescue.' Court action: The family of Russian heavyweight boxer Magomed Abdusalamov, 32 (pictured) who was beaten into a coma in a November 2 bout has filed a $100¿million lawsuit. Brutal: Magomed Abdusalamov (right) lost a bloody bout to Cuba's Mike Perez on November 2 and also broke his hand and nose.

The Dagestan native suffered a broken. nose and hand in the first round and was visibly disfigured by the fifth. round. In the seventh round, two ringside doctors inspected Abdusalamov but. cleared him to continue. Although Perez nearly knocked then 'Russian Tyson' down in the final round, the referee and his own trainer let. him finish the 10-round fight. The court papers say Abdusalamov, who absorbed 312 punches, was advised by state officials to go to a hospital when he urinated blood after the fight, but an ambulance was not provided. The severely injured boxer and his frightened family were forced to find a cab outside the entertainment venue during rush hour, the court papers say. 'They should have stopped the fight,' the fighter's cousin, Amin Suleymanov, told The New York Post. 'Everybody could see that.'

Doctors operated on his brain to remove the clot, then placed him in a medically induced coma to help ease the swelling in his brain. Abdusalamov suffered a stroke shortly after. He remained in a coma for several weeks, only awakening once briefly. Now, according to ESPN, he is in a rehabilitation facility and can move only slightly.

"Article: Anxiety may cause people to neglect their physical or emotional health, and you can help by suggesting that she do something if you notice she has forgotten. Self-soothing activities may be especially important if she has frequent anxiety. For example, ask her if she would like to get something to eat or suggest that she take a warm, long bath.  When dealing with children, engage in relaxing activities together. Let them pick what they want to do. Not everyone with anxiety will have an anxiety disorder but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t need to be dealt with. Set aside 30 minutes out of the day, where your loved one can just have a good worry. During this time, don’t let him be distracted by anything other than worrying and feeling anxious. Encourage him to think of solutions to his problems. This technique is effective with children as well as adults and helps them gain a sense of control over their problems. Your loved one may tell you why she feels upset, or you may have been able to tell based on what set off the anxiety. Try saying how upset she looks, and recognize that this is hard. This lets her know that you care, and that you think her struggles are valid. Ironically, affirming her stress can reduce it.  \"That sounds really hard.\" \"I can see why that would be upsetting to you. It sounds like visiting your father can be difficult for you sometimes.\" \"You look stressed. Your face is scrunched up and you look hunched over. Do you want to talk about it?\" Hugs can bring comfort to an anxious person. You may try to pat his back, give him a one-armed hug or put your arm around his shoulder to make him comfortable. Only do what you and he are comfortable with. Always give him opportunities to decline. If he is dealing with sensory overload or are autistic, touch may make things worse. Or he may not be in the mood. This can be an enormous relief to the anxious person. Be accommodating, and don't question her bad days or unusual needs. Treat her anxiety like a fact that, while unfortunate, is not a dreadful burden upon your life. Recognize that her feelings matter, and treat her with compassion, anxiety and all. Be flexible. It may take longer for people with anxiety problems to get ready for events such as getting ready for school. Factor in this time and allow for delays. If your loved one isn't being treated already, seeing a doctor about his anxiety may allow him to get the help he needs. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical or biological causes of the anxiety. Once you know that the cause of  your loved one’s anxiety is psychological, you will be in a better position to seek treatment. To give him a boost, you might suggest accompanying him to take notes, help him remember symptoms, or just for moral support. Asking others for help can be very encouraging for a person with anxiety problems. In fact, persons with strong informal support networks have increase their chances of benefitting from treatment for anxiety.  You don’t have to do anything specific. Just knowing that there are people around with whom to talk to and share her worries with, can help a person with anxiety problems feel better.\n"

"A good score on the Miller Analogies Test (MAT) depends on the requirements of the specific graduate program or institution you are considering, as well as how your score compares to those of other test-takers in the same pool. The MAT is a standardized test commonly used for graduate school admissions in the United States. It measures a candidate's ability to understand complex relationships and similarities through the use of analogies.\n"
"\n"
"The MAT consists of 120 analogy-based questions, which are divided into four categories:\n"
"\n"
"1. Semantic: These questions test vocabulary knowledge and general reasoning abilities.\n"
"2. Analytic: These questions require understanding relationships among terms and how these relationships apply to novel situations.\n"
"3. Classification: These questions test a candidate's ability to group items based on shared properties.\n"
"4. Syntactic: These questions examine understanding of word order and patterns in sentences.\n"
"\n"
"From these 120 questions, only 100 items contribute to the examinee's final score. The other 20 items are experimental and are used to evaluate their suitability for future test editions. Test-takers have 60 minutes to complete the MAT.\n"
"\n"
"MAT scores are reported as both a raw score and a scaled score, which range from 200 to 600. The raw score is simply the number of questions answered correctly, while the scaled score is adjusted to account for differences in difficulty between different test editions. The test developer, Pearson, also provides a percentile rank for the scaled scores, which show the percentage of test-takers scoring below a given score.\n"
"\n"
"Now, to determine what a \"good\" score is, consider the following factors:\n"
"\n"
"1. Graduate program requirements: Some graduate programs have minimum MAT score requirements, while others provide score ranges for their typical successful applicants. To identify what may be considered a good score for the program you are interested in, research the program's website or contact their admissions office.\n"
"\n"
"2. Comparisons to other test-takers: Percentile ranks provide a useful comparison to understand how your score compares to others. A higher percentile rank indicates better performance as compared to other test-takers. Generally, a percentile rank of 50 or above would indicate that you scored higher than half of the test-takers, while a rank above 70 or 80 would place you in the top 30% or 20%, respectively.\n"
"\n"
"3. Personal goals: Consider your own academic background and the competitiveness of the programs you are applying to when setting a personal target MAT score.\n"
"\n"
"To provide a general idea, examinees who score around 400 or above are typically considered to have performed well on the MAT. However, highly competitive graduate programs may expect scores closer to 500 or even higher to stand out in the applicant pool.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, a good score on the Miller Analogies Test depends on several factors, including the requirements of the graduate program you are interested in, how your score compares to other test-takers, and your personal goals. To increase your chances of admission, strive for a score significantly above the minimum required or the average score range for your desired program."

"While Mr. Obama emerged from the four primaries on Tuesday with an advantage in pledged delegates, efforts to persuade Democrats to unite around him were slowed by the strongest performance Mrs. Clinton had registered in a month.\n"

"David Axelrod, the chief strategist for Mr. Obama, said the Clinton campaign had pursued the approach of “attack, attack, attack.” But the defeats in Rhode Island, Ohio and Texas would not greatly affect the state of the race, Mr. Axelrod said, adding, “They promised they would wipe out our delegate lead, but they haven’t put a dent in it.”\n"
"\n"
"Mr. Axelrod signaled a fierce fight in the coming weeks. “What’s good for the goose is good for the gander,” he said.\n"

"He said voters should consider Mrs. Clinton’s decision not to release her tax returns and papers from former President Bill Clinton’s library. Mr. Axelrod also challenged the press to look closely at her legislative achievements.\n"

"The invention of the radio cannot be attributed to a single individual, as it is a result of the collective work and contributions of several inventors and scientists over many years. The development of radio technology was a collaborative effort, with discoveries and inventions from various individuals shaping the way radio functions today. However, some of the central figures who have played significant roles in the invention of radio include:\n"
"\n"
"1. James Clerk Maxwell: A Scottish physicist, Maxwell is known for his development of a set of equations that described the relationship between electricity and magnetism, known as Maxwell's Equations. These equations laid the groundwork for the understanding of electromagnetic waves, and eventually, the development of radio communication.\n"
"\n"
"2. Heinrich Hertz: A German physicist, Hertz was the first person to demonstrate that electromagnetic waves could be transmitted through the air. In 1887, he performed a series of experiments validating Maxwell's theories and proved the existence of electromagnetic waves. Hertz's work laid the foundation for the invention of radio technology.\n"
"\n"
"3. David Edward Hughes: As mentioned in your answer, around 1880, Hughes, a British-American inventor, was likely the first to intentionally transmit a signal using electromagnetic waves. Although his contemporaries at the time considered this to be induction, his work is now recognized as an early precursor to radio transmissions.\n"
"\n"
"4. Guglielmo Marconi: An Italian inventor, Marconi is often referred to as the \"father of radio.\" He is known for his pioneering work in long-distance radio transmissions. In 1895, Marconi built a wireless system that was capable of transmitting signals over long distances. He continued to develop and refine his radio technology, resulting in several patents. In 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the first wireless signal across the Atlantic Ocean.\n"
"\n"
"5. Nikola Tesla: A Serbian-American inventor and engineer, Tesla developed several key technologies related to radio. In 1891, he demonstrated wireless energy transmission through electromagnetic waves. Tesla filed a series of patents between 1897 and 1900, which covered the basic components of a radio transmitter and receiver. Unfortunately, Tesla's work on radio technology was overshadowed by Marconi's achievements.\n"
"\n"
"6. Reginald Fessenden: A Canadian-American inventor, Fessenden made significant contributions to the development of radiotelephony. In 1900, he discovered a method called amplitude modulation (AM) that allowed voice to be transmitted wirelessly via radio waves. On Christmas Eve of 1906, Fessenden made history by broadcasting music and speech using a radio transmitter.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the invention of radio cannot be attributed to a single individual. While Guglielmo Marconi is often referred to as the inventor of radio due to his significant contributions, it is essential to acknowledge the efforts and work of other inventors such as James Clerk Maxwell, Heinrich Hertz, David Edward Hughes, Nikola Tesla, and Reginald Fessenden, among others. Their collective work and advancements laid the groundwork for the development of radio technology as we know it today."

"Article Title: The Miracle Brazilian Baby Who Survived Stray Bullet and Cherishes Hopes for Future\n"
"\n"
"Article:\n"
"\n"
"In an astounding tale of survival and strength, a Brazilian baby boy has been deemed a miracle after surviving a shooting while still in his mother's womb. The stray bullet, an unintentional bi-product of rampant street violence, ended up embedding itself in the unborn child. The family now cherishes high hopes that their little warrior will one day overcome his injuries and walk.\n"
"\n"
"The incident traces back to an unfortunate day when the baby's mother was caught amid gunfire, a recurrent narrative in some Brazilian towns notorious for their high crime rates. In the horror of the moment, a stray bullet traveled its aimless path and ended up in the most vulnerable spot possible - her womb.\n"
"\n"
"A routine ultrasound revealed the unimaginable. While the expectant mother was fortunately unhurt, their unborn child bore the brunt of the lethal bullet. The fetal images showed metal lodged into the baby's spine. Amid the shock and despair, doctors prepared the family for the worst, warning them about possible severe impairments.\n"
"\n"
"That brings us to the present day, where the extraordinary survival story of this child began. The baby, now several months old, has been defying medical expectations since his birth. With every passing day, he strengthens his claim to his title - the Miracle Baby Boy. He not only survived the gunshot ordeal but is thriving, against all odds.\n"
"\n"
"His family, although still reeling from the incident, is brimming with hope. They believe their little miracle will not only live a normal life but will also overcome the potentially crippling injuries. Encapsulated in their faith is a dream - a dream of their son taking his first steps, a dream heightened by every baby step he makes towards recovery.\n"
"\n"
"Treatment for the baby is ongoing, and given the complexity of his condition, the path to recovery is steep. His family, underlining the importance of perseverance and patience, is committed to providing the best for him and ensuring he hits every developmental milestone.\n"
"\n"
"Stories like these serve as stark reminders of the unintentional victims of gun violence. Yet, they also highlight the invincible spirit of survival and an overwhelming force of faith and hope in the face of the direst circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"The miracle baby has already become a symbol of courage and resilience in his community in Brazil. Despite the hardship, his story brings inspiration, instills hope and advocates for love and peace, even amid life's harshest of storms. In every sense of the word, the little boy is a miracle - a shining beacon that life, even when born amidst despair and violence, can be incredibly resilient.\n"
"\n"
"Therefore, this tale of survival shall not only make us reflect on the issues that plague our societies but also restore faith in the seemingly impossible. Moreover, it reminds us that miracles do exist, and sometimes, they come in the smallest of forms, defying the mightiest of odds. In the end, it is hope that propels us - hope for a better future, hope for these miracles to overcome challenges and hope for a world where children are born into love and peace, not violence."

"Background: The Colbert Report () is an American late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Stephen Colbert that aired four days a week on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005 to December 18, 2014 for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor.\n"
"Context: The character first made appearances on the short-lived sketch comedy series The Dana Carvey Show in 1996, described as \"a self-important, trench-coated reporter who does on-location stories in a way that suggests his own presence is the real scoop.\"  When The Daily Show ran short on time, a short piece starring Colbert, advertising a fictional program titled The Colbert Report, was added into the program. In these sketches, Colbert began to amplify his character to parody news pundits. Colbert anchored many sketches in his persona, including \"Even Stepvhen\", in which he debated current issues with fellow correspondent Steve Carell, often devolving into petty name-calling and insults. Colbert and Carell were viewed as potential breakout stars by staff, and when Carell left the series in 2004 to start a US version of The Office, Comedy Central made attempts to keep Colbert at the network. Stewart and Karlin were already looking to expand the Daily Show franchise and their production company, Busboy. The duo supposedly came up with the idea for The Colbert Report after watching coverage of the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Bill O'Reilly. Colbert met with network president Doug Herzog the day following the 2004 Emmy Awards to first discuss the concept. The one-line pitch Colbert, Karlin and Stewart developed was \"Our version of the O'Reilly Factor with Stephen Colbert.\" Herzog committed to an eight-week tryout period without a pilot.  By the time of the 2004 election, the character was fully developed. In creating the character, which is designed to be repellant but entertaining, Colbert conferred with Stewart and Karlin. In expressing his hope that his character not be \"an asshole,\" Stewart remarked, \"You're not an asshole. You're an idiot. There's a difference.\" Head writer Allison Silverman reiterated this trait in a later interview, commenting, \"There is an essential innocence to his character.\" Colbert initially felt the character might not be sustainable in a longer format. Despite this, The Colbert Report was designed as an extension of the satiric goals of The Daily Show, combining it with general silliness and character-driven humor. To make sure there was no overlap in subject matter with The Daily Show, Karlin made trips between the studios during the show's early days to supervise scripts. For the first several years of the program, Colbert made an appearance at the end of each Daily Show in split-screen, having a short discussion with Stewart preceding his show.\n"

"Neil was captivated by the entire process, as Randy meticulously explained each step, emphasizing the importance of the materials, the finesse of assembly, and the final touches that made the homemade whiteboard truly unique. As they embarked on this crafty project together, Neil found himself thoroughly engrossed in learning, asking questions, and even offering creative suggestions at various stages of the process.\n"
"\n"
"Randy kicked off the demonstration by outlining the list of materials they would need. This included a white, non-porous surface such as a smooth piece of melamine board or a white Plexiglas sheet, simple wood or aluminum trim to create a frame, strong adhesive, mounting hardware, a measuring tape, a hand saw, and sandpaper. Neil could hardly contain his curiosity, making mental notes of the most vital items he'd require to recreate the project on his own.\n"
"\n"
"As they began the groundwork, Randy elaborately demonstrated how to cut the white surface precisely to the desired dimensions, ensuring that the lines were straight and clean. He also discussed the crucial role of sandpaper to smooth out any imperfections in the cut, and he even shared tricks to avoid splinters when using wooden surfaces. Neil, captivated by the expert knowledge Randy possessed, committed everything to memory in a bid to perfect his own future homemade whiteboards.\n"
"\n"
"Randy continued the lesson by presenting a variety of framing options, showcasing the pros and cons of wooden, aluminum, or even plastic frames.

Together, they carefully cut and sanded the frame pieces, measuring and attaching them to the whiteboard using a strong adhesive. Neil closely observed Randy's precision, admiring the craftsmanship that went into constructing such a polished product.\n"
"\n"
"They let the adhesive dry, and then Randy showed Neil how to securely mount the whiteboard on the wall using sturdy brackets and anchors, ensuring that it stayed in place without causing any damage. Randy further demonstrated how to conceal the hardware beneath the frame for a sleek appearance, impressing Neil with the aural and visual fixation of the DIY project.\n"
"\n"
"The glorious final touch was adding a compact tray beneath the whiteboard to store markers and an eraser. Randy explained the importance of selecting the right material for easy cleaning, as well as the best placement to ensure both accessibility and aesthetics. By this point, Neil had all the knowledge and inspiration he needed to create his very own masterpiece of a whiteboard, and he couldn't wait to embark on this journey.\n"
"\n"
"Throughout the entire process, Neil was captivated by Randy's guidance and expertise.

"doorway was supposed to be wide enough to accommodate her new bookshelf, but unfortunately, it had a narrow wooden frame jutting out of it, and she couldn't cram the bulky item through the passage.\n"
"\n"
"Frustrated and determined, Julia decided to remove the obstruction that prevented her from placing her new bookshelf in its rightful place inside her living room. She headed to the garage to gather supplies, searching for the tools she would need for the project. As she rummaged through dusty bins and cluttered shelves, she found a handsaw, a hammer, a chisel, and some protective gloves and goggles. With confidence in her eyes and a ready stance, she strode back to the doorframe, ready to tackle the task at hand.\n"
"\n"
"First, she donned the goggles and gloves for safety, ensuring that her hands and eyes were protected from any splinters or debris that might fly off during the removal process. Then, carefully examining the wooden frame, she chose the right spot to make her initial cut. Julia wielded the handsaw, positioning it at a slight angle against the grain of the wood. With determination, she began to saw slowly through the frame, being cautious of the surrounding walls and paying close attention to the piece of wood she was attempting to remove. Sawdust and wood shavings settled to the ground as the blade bit into the material.\n"
"\n"
"Once she had made a clean incision, Julia then took up the chisel and hammer. She gently wedged the chisel into the cut that she had made with the saw. Grasping the hammer with confidence, she gave the chisel a firm tap, driving it further into the opening. With each strike, the wooden piece became gradually dislodged, as splinters and chips cascaded to the floor.\n"
"\n"
"Julia continued this process until she could finally see the wooden segment loosening enough to be removed by hand. With a proud grin, she grabbed hold of the frame and gave it a good yank. As the wood came free from the doorway with a gratifying snap, she couldn't help but feel a rush of triumph.\n"
"\n"
"Julia took a moment to brush the debris away from the area, ensuring that no hazards remained. She closely examined her work, making sure that the doorway's structural integrity remained intact and strong. Satisfied with her handiwork, she finally returned the tools to their places in the garage and began preparations to move her bookshelf into her living room.\n"
"\n"
"With the doorway now widened and rid of the troublesome wooden frame, Julia was able to position her bookshelf exactly where she envisioned it. As she placed her beloved books onto the new shelves, she took pride in her handiwork and the perseverance it took her to overcome this unexpected obstacle.\n"
"\n"
"Julia knew that she had not only managed to alter her doorway to fit her new furniture but had also grown as an individual. Through determination and resourcefulness, she had faced her problem head-on and welcomed the challenge presented before her. And in the process, she had discovered that she was capable of more than she initially thought. In removing the wood from the doorway, Julia had carved out a new and exciting chapter in her life, opening her heart and mind to the endless possibilities that she could conquer, one task at a time."

"Title: Autism and Violence - Dispelling the Myths Surrounding the Adam Lanza Case\n"
"\n"
"Introduction\n"
"Recently, a relative of Adam Lanza, the infamous school shooter, claimed that Lanza had a form of autism. According to a law enforcement official, this claim has raised concerns about the public's perception of those with autism and generated unfounded speculation regarding the link between violence and autism. In this article, we aim to clarify the misconceptions about autism and highlight expert opinions on the matter.\n"
"\n"
"1. Understanding Autism Spectrum Disorders\n"
"Autism, or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interactions, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Individuals with ASD often face challenges in understanding and responding to the social world around them. Importantly, autism is not a personality disorder and should not be confused with conditions like antisocial personality disorder.\n"
"\n"
"2. Advocacy Groups Caution Against Speculation\n"
"Advocacy groups, including the Autistic Self Advocacy Network and Autism Society, urge caution when discussing the alleged link between violence and autism. The groups stress that individuals with autism are far more likely to be victims rather than perpetrators of violence. Moreover, experts argue that reinforcing stereotypes may contribute to the discrimination and exclusion of those with ASD.\n"
"\n"
"3. Expert Opinion on Violence and Autism\n"
"Dr. Valerie Gaus, a clinical psychologist who specializes in autism, states that violence perpetuated by individuals with autism spectrum disorders is typically reactive and impulsive, rather than planned. She explains that most violent acts by people with autism are a response to feelings of being threatened or overwhelmed, rather than a premeditated, calculated effort to cause harm.\n"
"\n"
"In contrast, the planning and execution of the tragic events perpetrated by Adam Lanza indicate a degree of forethought and intention that is inconsistent with the reactive nature of violence typically observed in individuals with ASD. Therefore, it is important to recognize that Lanza's actions are not representative of the autistic community’s behavior.\n"
"\n"
"4. The Importance of Dispelling Myths\n"
"Understanding the true nature of autism and dispelling myths about its association with violence is crucial in promoting acceptance and support for those with ASD. Discrimination and stigmatization only serve to alienate and marginalize a community that already grapples with social challenges. \n"
"\n"
"By educating the public on the realities of autism, we can work together to create a more inclusive and compassionate society, where people with ASD are recognized for their strengths and supported in their areas of need.\n"
"\n"
"Conclusion\n"
"The tragic actions of Adam Lanza should not be used as a basis to judge or stereotype individuals with autism. Instead, it is imperative that we remain vigilant in questioning and debunking unfounded assumptions about the relationship between autism and violence. Doing so will help create a more empathetic and informed society, one that embraces individuals with autism spectrum disorders and supports their growth, inclusion, and well-being."

"A Florida waitress who went the extra mile after a customer left behind $1,000 in cash has been rewarded for her honesty, even though she returned the money to the wrong guy. Pregnant Samantha Knight, of Punta Gorda, found the stash of $100 dollar bills on the seat at one of her tables during her Tuesday night shift at Laishley Crab House. An unusual series of events, including giving the money to the wrong person, ended with her being given the full $1,000 plus an extra $100 tip. Ms Knight initially raced to the front of the restaurant to return the money roll to the customer she thought had left it behind - but she handed it to the wrong guy, and he left with the $1,000. Take the money and run: Surveillance footage at Laishley Crab House shows a waitress handing over $1,000 in lost cash she believed belonged to the man leaving on the right. Mix-up: Waitress Samantha Knight says she thought she was returning it to the right customer, and he acted like the lost money was his. The mix-up happened last Tuesday at Laishley Crab House in Punta Gorda, Florida. 'I was like \"you left this in the booth.\" He said \"thanks,\" patted his pocket, took it and walked away,' Ms Knight told WBBH. It was only after the man left with the small fortune that the waitress realized she mixed up tables and handed the money to the wrong customer. The man who actually dropped the money, Chuck Behm, was filmed leaving the restaurant just one minute prior - he soon came back looking for his cash. When told what happened, he was upset and said he'd have let her keep it. He didn't blame her for the confusion, instead blaming the guy who initially took money that wasn't his. 'I felt awful. I still feel madder than anything at that guy,' he told WBBH from back home in Chicago. There's that money I forgot: The man is filmed taking a mint from the restaurant's front desk on his way out when Ms Knight stops him and hands him the money. He easily accepts the wad of $100 dollar bills. Taking the cash: The man even pats his pocket as if the wad of bills fell out. Left too soon: The man the money actually belonged to, Charles Behm, was filmed leaving the restaurant just one minute before Ms Knight ran to catch the customer. Mr Behm then said that if the money was returned he would give it to the pregnant Ms Knight. After. contacting local television stations, and even having the young. waitress give an on-air interview, the man who took the money realized. it wasn't his and returned it. He said, in an interesting coincidence,. that he also had $1,000 cash in $100 bills on him at the restaurant. After he returned the money, the man, who asked not to be identified, gave the soon-to-be-mother an extra $100 tip 'for her troubles.' When contacted by Ms Knight to say the money was returned, Mr Behm stayed true to his word and told the hard working woman to keep it. 'I called him this morning and let him know,' she told the New York Daily News. 'He said, \"It's yours to keep.\"' Honesty does pay off, and Ms Knight's proof is in her purse being $1,100 richer. What a tip! If the money is returned, Mr Behm plans to give it all to Ms Knight, who is currently expecting a baby.\n"

"The legal change meant Sinclair, who has been in prison since the 1980s, could be retried after the court case against him collapsed seven years previously.\n"
"The judge ordered him to spend a minimum of 37 years in jail - the same number of years that the families of the girls had waited for justice.\n"
"Last year, Sinclair dropped an appeal against the conviction but continued in a bid to have the term reduced, arguing it was \"excessive\".\n"
"A hearing was held in November but judges have now refused the appeal, meaning the punishment part of Sinclair's sentence will stand.\n"
"Among the submissions from Sinclair's legal team was the question of whether 37 years was \"necessary, appropriate and fell within the judge's discretion\".\n"
"They also argued about whether or not some of his earlier convictions should have been taken into account in determining the punishment part of the sentence as they were events which came after the 1977 murders.\n"
"Lady Paton, Lady Clark and Lord Malcolm delivered their opinion in a written judgment published on Thursday.\n"
"They said: \"We do not accept that the sentencing judge selected 37 years because that represented the length of time which had passed since the commission of the murders.\n"
"\"As the sentencing judge explains, he had concluded at the outset that a punishment part 'in the high 30s' should be imposed. That was his assessment of the gravity of the case.\n"
"\"As he puts it, it was only 'coincidentally' that the period selected mirrored the passage of time since the murders. In the result we are not persuaded that there is any merit in this argument.\"\n"
"They also rejected the arguments relating to his criminal record and refused the appeal.\n"
"A Crown Office spokesman said: \"We note the decision of the appeal court.\n"
"\"This brings to an end the long wait for justice for the families of Helen and Christine.\n"
"\"This was made possible by the hard work and dedication of all senior investigation officers, police officers, procurators fiscal, forensic scientists, police surgeons, forensic pathologists, forensic soil scientists, toxicologists and other witnesses who willingly gave their time and expertise to bring Angus Sinclair to justice.\"\n"

"The Redskins kicked off their 2015 regular season by hosting the Miami Dolphins. After a Kai Forbath field goal put the Redskins up 3-0, they got the ball back, and newly minted starting quarterback Kirk Cousins threw a deep pass to DeSean Jackson. The ball was overthrown, and Jackson sustained a hamstring injury while stretching out to attempt to catch it. Early in the second quarter, Cousins was intercepted by Miami cornerback Brent Grimes at the Redskins' 25-yard-line, continuing a trend from previous seasons of turnovers and ill-advised throws. Grimes returned the interception 11 yards to the 14-yard-line, but the Dolphins failed to score any points off of the turnover. Near the end of the first half, with Washington still nursing a 3-0 lead, Cousins tossed a 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jordan Reed, putting the Redskins up 10-0. Miami scored right before halftime, with Ryan Tannehill throwing a 3-yard touchdown pass to receiver Rishard Matthews with 27 seconds remaining. Washington led 10-7 entering halftime. Miami got the ball to begin the second half, and on 3rd and 7 from the Miami 45-yard-line, Tannehill threw deep down the right sideline to former Pro Bowl tight end Jordan Cameron for a gain of 27. However, on 3rd and 4 from the Redskins' 22-yard-line, inside of Miami kicker Andrew Franks' range, defensive end Jason Hatcher forced a Tannehill fumble that was bobbled all the way back to the Miami 40 and recovered by Redskins rookie outside linebacker Preston Smith. The Redskins did not capitalize, however, losing two yards on an Alfred Morris run and two short Cousins passes. On their next possession, Washington drove to the Miami 22-yard-line&#8212;easily inside Forbath's range&#8212;but three consecutive penalties pushed them back 24 yards and forced a punt, squandering a valuable chance to extend the lead. On the ensuing drive, Franks converted a 22-yard field goal attempt to tie the score at 10-10 entering the fourth quarter. The Redskins continued to have no success on offense, resulting in a punt to Dolphins receiver Jarvis Landry, who fielded the ball at the Miami 31-yard-line, broke a few tackles and burst into the clear for a 69-yard score and a 17-10 Dolphins lead. On 3rd and 13 from their own 29-yard-line, with a chance to cut into or tie the Dolphins' lead, Cousins threw to the endzone for Pierre Gar&#231;on, but the ball was intercepted by Miami cornerback Brice McCain, ending the Redskins attempt at a potential field goal to narrow the deficit. That ended up being Washington's best chance, as they could not score on any of their subsequent possessions. Miami scored 17 unanswered points and shut out the Redskins in the second half to win 17-10 and win their third straight season opener under coach Joe Philbin. Washington, by contrast, lost in Week 1 for the third consecutive season and for the second straight time under head coach Jay Gruden. After the game, it was announced that receiver DeSean Jackson would miss several weeks with his hamstring injury, and that kicker Kai Forbath had been released and replaced by former Buffalo Bills and New Orleans Saints kicker Dustin Hopkins.\n"

"When getting married, the bride chose the vanilla cake over the chocolate, as she believed that the chocolate tasted cheap. The decision had been made after much contemplation, as everyone knew the bride was an ardent chocolate lover. So, it naturally came as a surprise when she decided to break with tradition and opt for a vanilla cake.\n"
"\n"
"The wedding preparations were well underway, and every detail was being carefully planned, from the extravagant decorations down to the scrumptious menu. Among various opinions, tastes and preferences, choosing the right cake flavor turned out to be one of the most fiercely debated subjects. However, the bride had her reasons to pick vanilla, and she eventually laid her case as to why chocolate can taste cheap.\n"
"\n"
"First, she argued that many chocolate cakes often use subpar or low-quality chocolate. The quality of cocoa and other ingredients can greatly impact the taste of the final product. Choosing a high-quality chocolate for the cake can sometimes be challenging, and the difference is noticeable in taste. She feared that settling for a low-quality chocolate cake would leave her and her guests underwhelmed on the big day.\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, she explained that when it comes to wedding cakes, pastry chefs and bakers often prioritize design and stability, which means that they might end up sacrificing some of the flavor in the process. A good chocolate cake is moist and rich, but sometimes, in order to design a cake that can support its beautiful decorations and multiple layers, the baker might make the cake drier or denser than desired. This, in turn, can affect the overall taste and texture of the chocolate cake.\n"
"\n"
"Next, she maintained that chocolate as a flavor can be overpowering. While it is undeniably a crowd favorite, chocolate in its many forms can easily overshadow the other delicate flavors served at the wedding. The bride, being a food connoisseur, wanted everyone to savor each dish on the menu, and she worried that having a chocolate wedding cake might dull their taste buds.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, she reasoned that choosing a vanilla cake would cater to a wider audience, including those who might not prefer chocolate. A well-made vanilla cake is versatile, delicate, and pairs well with various frostings, fillings, and beverage pairings. This would make it an ideal choice for all guests, respecting their diverse tastes and preferences.\n"
"\n"
"As time passed and the wedding date approached, the bride sought out the best bakery in town for her dream vanilla cake. After trying countless samples, she settled on a multi-layered, vanilla masterpiece. Delightfully moist, fragranced with the finest Madagascar vanilla beans, and adorned with a smooth, buttercream frosting – the cake was an ode to the sophistication and elegance that encapsulated her special day. \n"
"\n"
"At the wedding reception, the vanilla cake was unveiled to the awe of everyone present. Amid delicate floral arrangements and other tantalizing desserts, it emerged as the centerpiece of a lavish, tasteful spread. As everyone took their first bite, the bride couldn't help but notice the look of pure, unadulterated joy on their faces – even the staunchest chocolate aficionados couldn't resist its charm!"

"\n"
"Alfred (40) and Carmen (35) are a loving couple who have been trying to conceive a baby for the past five years. They have been to numerous doctors and fertility specialists who cannot seem to identify the problem preventing them from starting their family. \n"
"\n"
"Despite their lack of success, Alfred and Carmen remain determined to become parents, exhausting all available methods, like consulting alternative medicine practitioners and exploring holistic approaches to improve fertility. During those years, they begin dealing with the emotional strain and start questioning their worth as a couple.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, Alfred undergoes a fertility test that reveals a shocking truth - he has a sperm count of zero. Alarmed by the news, Alfred begins to feel a deep sense of inadequacy as a man and a potential father, doubting his entire future with Carmen.\n"
"\n"
"While sharing his concerns with Carmen, she doesn't falter and demonstrates her commitment to Alfred by suggesting they adopt a child or explore other options, like in-vitro fertilization and surrogacy. As they embark on this new journey, their relationship is tested and deepened, and they rediscover the importance of love and partnership.\n"
"\n"
"At one of their appointments with a fertility expert, they learn of a groundbreaking clinical trial for male infertility. After thorough assessments, they find out that Alfred is eligible for the experimental treatment. Hopeful, they agree to participate in this medical trial.\n"
"\n"
"As Alfred undergoes the treatment, Carmen starts volunteering at a local orphanage to cope with her overwhelming feelings of helplessness and frustration. The couple begins to bond with one of the children at the orphanage, a young boy named Connor, who seems to have a magical effect on those around him.\n"
"\n"
"During the clinical trial, Alfred and Carmen's marriage faces severe stress. Struggling to maintain a semblance of normalcy, they feel a mix of emotions - hope, anger, sadness, and guilt - in their quest to start a family. The connection with Connor provides solace and a new sense of purpose in their lives.\n"
"\n"
"A few months into the process, Alfred receives the incredible news that his sperm count has drastically improved. Excited, they leave the clinical trial, believing they can now begin trying to conceive naturally. Simultaneously, they maintain their relationship with Connor and the orphanage.\n"
"\n"
"In an unexpected twist, Carmen becomes pregnant after a few months of trying. Their joy is multiplied when the orphanage informs them that they have been approved to adopt Connor, whom they have grown to love unmistakably.\n"
"\n"
"As this heartwarming story of love and determination unfolds, Alfred and Carmen learn that the gift of life isn't a one-size-fits-all experience.

"Most Japanese people dress fairly similarly to westerners so you won’t have to worry about buying specific clothes for your trip. However, Japanese culture places a slightly higher premium on professional attire in public places than exists in the west. Err towards packing and wearing your nicer clothing.  Adult men generally don’t wear shorts in Japan, even in hotter weather.  Expectations for women to dress modestly are slightly higher in Japan than in the west. Japanese women usually cover their shoulders and avoid form-fitting clothes. However, this expectation is less present in major cities like Tokyo.  Flip-flops are not commonly worn in public in Japan. It won’t be considered rude but you may get strange looks. Body language signals are more intentional and universally understood in Japan than in most western cultures. A subtle nod, smile or placement of your hands can drastically change the meaning of your words. While Japanese people used to dealing with westerners will understand if you haven’t totally mastered these signals, there are some body language signals that could be considered rude.  Try to keep your back straight at all times. Slouching while sitting or leaning against a wall while standing is considered rude and dismissive of your companions.  Don’t keep your hands in your pockets during a conversation. Point with your hand, not your finger. Pointing with a finger can be considered as an insult or even a threat. Japanese people are very conscientious about spreading germs. This is especially true in major cities like Tokyo because a lot of public places are very crowded and contagious illness can spread easily.  Don’t blow your nose in public places. Find a bathroom instead. Cough into the crook of your arm rather than your hand so you cover more of your mouth. If you have a cold, wearing a surgical mask so you don’t get others sick is considered polite. Japanese people generally like to leave a bit more space between them during conversations. Try to leave enough space so that if both conversants were to bow at the same time, there would be no risk of bumping heads. Touching is generally discouraged and can be perceived as overly familiar or aggressive. This includes common and benign western actions like patting someone’s shoulder. Bowing is the most common form of nonverbal communication. While bowing conventions are fairly elaborate, using two types of bows should suffice for a visitor.  A deep bow is often used when apologizing or meeting someone of a higher station. Keep your legs and back straight and bend at the waist. Bend far enough so that your face is pointing toward the floor and hold the position for at least 2 full seconds before returning to the upright position.  You should definitely perform a deep bow for an employer or anyone you deem to be particularly prestigious. Anyone that is substantially older than you is considered to be of higher station as well.  A smaller bow is considered, to some extent, the equivalent of a handshake. Keep your legs and back straight and bend at the waist and return to your starting position quickly. It is proper for meeting people of similar age or station."

"Title: \"Tragic End for IT Aspirant: Victim of Senseless Crime\"\n"
"\n"
"In a shocking turn of events, Thavisha Lakindu Peiris, a promising young Sri Lankan, was brutally knifed to death in his car for his phone, as reported in a recent court hearing. The quiet and gentle 25-year-old was on the verge of starting a new career in Information Technology (IT) when his life was tragically cut short due to the senseless act of violence.\n"
"\n"
"An unfortunate chain of events led to Thavisha's untimely demise. He was working his last shift at his part-time job and was about to clock off. However, he was persuaded to take one final delivery before finishing his day. Little did he know that this seemingly innocuous decision would result in an appalling and life-changing encounter.\n"
"\n"
"While on his last delivery, Thavisha was brutally attacked for his phone, a motive which highlights the tragic prevalence of crime and violence dominating today's society. Thavisha, a hard-working, ambitious, and gentle young man, had moved from Sri Lanka to pursue a promising career in the IT industry. His life and the hopes of his family were shattered when the defendants, Shamraze Khan and Kasim Ahmed, callously targeted him.\n"
"\n"
"During the court proceedings, it was revealed that Shamraze Khan had been charged with Thavisha's murder. On the other hand, Kasim Ahmed pleaded guilty to the heinous crime, accepting full responsibility for his appalling actions. Both defendants now face the specter of justice for their cold-blooded actions that ended an innocent young man's life.\n"
"\n"
"Thavisha's murder brings to light the harrowing dangers faced by individuals engaging in seemingly safe tasks, such as making deliveries for occupations that are traditionally viewed as low-risk. His death highlights the pressing need for greater safety measures for employees in these sectors, as well as a renewed focus on addressing crime and violence in our communities.\n"
"\n"
"The senseless murder of Thavisha Lakindu Peiris has sent ripples of shock and sorrow throughout the community. His family, friends, and colleagues are grappling with the traumatic reality of losing someone so young and full of potential. Thavisha's story underscores the critical importance of addressing the systemic issues of crime, violence, and the need for preventive safety measures to ensure that such a tragedy does not befall another innocent person.\n"
"\n"
"As our society grapples with pervasive crime and violence, it is essential that we take meaningful action to implement strategies to curb these alarming trends. We need to invest in community-based initiatives, education, and law enforcement efforts to combat the root causes of crime and prevent needless acts of violence, like Thavisha's murder, from recurring.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the immeasurable loss of Thavisha Lakindu Peiris serves as a stark reminder of the urgency to address the societal issues surrounding crime and violence. Moving forward, it is the responsibility of our communities and institutions to implement comprehensive action plans to prevent future tragedies such as this and to create a safer world where talented, hard-working individuals like Thavisha can realize their dreams and achieve their fullest potential."

"entrance of the mine had been sealed off for decades due to an old legend that warned of a curse, leaving its depths untouched and the precious gold hidden from the world.\n"
"\n"
"As the adventurers carefully navigated through the dimly-lit, narrow tunnels, they marveled at the vivid blue-green hue of the aquamarine gemstones that seemed to be scattered haphazardly throughout the mine's walls. The gemstones seemed to shimmer and glint under the faint glow of their torchlights, as if inviting the explorers to pocket their unearthly beauty. Each person in the group couldn't help but feel elated at the sight of these precious gems, knowing that their worth would make their efforts worthwhile.\n"
"\n"
"However, the real prize, gold nuggets, were much more elusive in this seemingly perplexing labyrinth that made up the old mine. The rumors of gold had initially lured the group to this forsaken place, with tales of untold riches that were allegedly buried deep within the bowels of the Earth, just waiting to be unearthed. As the hours turned into days, the once-hopeful adventurers felt their spirits dampening, and doubts began to set in as to whether they would ever find the treasure they so desperately sought.\n"
"\n"
"Unbeknownst to the group, the reason behind the scarcity of gold nuggets lied within the old legend that the entrance of the mine had been sealed off due to the curse, placed upon it by the ancient spirits of the mountain as a punishment for their ancestors' relentless greed and desecration of the sacred land. The curse lay upon those who sought fortune in the mine, ensuring that they would find nothing but misfortune and danger within. It also kept the gold nuggets from sight, effectively hiding them from the greedy hands of those seeking wealth, no matter how long they searched.\n"
"\n"
"As the adventurers' morale deteriorated, the leader of the group, a grizzled veteran of previous treasure-hunting expeditions, attempted to rally his comrades with tales of their past successes and adventures, emphasizing the inherent risk of treasure hunting, and explaining that perseverance would eventually pay off. For a brief moment, this instilled new hope among the group, and they pressed on with renewed determination.\n"
"\n"
"Eventually, after countless hours of grueling exploration, one of the adventurers noticed a small gap in one of the walls, partially hidden behind an unassuming boulder. It appeared unnatural and intentional, as if constructed with purpose. With a sense of excitement, the group proceeded to remove the boulder and squeeze through the gap, only to discover a hidden chamber adorned with intricate carvings and seemingly ancient artifacts.\n"
"\n"
"And, much to their amazement, gold nuggets – a fortune beyond their wildest dreams – were scattered across the chamber's floor like leaves in a golden forest. As they stared in awe at the sight before them, they realized that they had finally uncovered the lost treasure they sought, and that they had done so by both embracing their determination and defying the old legend. The curse, it seemed, had finally been broken with their unyielding persistence, paving the way for their success and ultimately rewarding them with the gold nuggets they had desired."

"Manziel was born in Tyler, Texas, on December 6, 1992, to Michelle (nee Liberato) and Paul Manziel. He has a younger sister named Meri. Manziel's great-great-grandfather Joseph immigrated to the United States in 1883 from the Mount Lebanon region of Syria in what is now Lebanon. He is of Italian descent on his maternal side.\n"
"\n"
"Texas A&M faced uncertainty at the quarterback position when Ryan Tannehill left for the National Football League after the 2011 season. Manziel performed well during spring ball and fall practices and won the starting job over Jameill Showers and Matt Joeckel before the season began. His first game was supposed to be against Louisiana Tech in Shreveport, Louisiana on Thursday, August 30, 2012, but the game was postponed until October 13 due to Hurricane Isaac hitting the Louisiana coast two days prior to game time. Consequently, Manziel's college football debut was played as a redshirt freshman against the Florida Gators before a home crowd at Kyle Field.  Although Manziel began the season in relative obscurity, his play against Arkansas in which he broke Archie Manning's 43-year-old total offense record gained him some attention. Manziel produced 557 yards of total offense, breaking Manning's record of 540. Two games later, Manziel surpassed his own total offense record against #24 Louisiana Tech by achieving 576 yards of total offense, becoming the first player in SEC history to have two 500+ total offense games in one season. After Texas A&M's blowout of Auburn in the eighth game of the season, in which Manziel accounted for 3 passing and 2 rushing touchdowns through only the first half plus one series in the second, Manziel began showing up in national Heisman Watch lists.  Manziel was launched into the national scene after he led Texas A&M to a 29-24 victory over #1 Alabama in Tuscaloosa. In that game, Manziel accounted for 345 of A&M's 418 yards of offense, including two passing touchdowns. In the following days, Manziel became the frontrunner for the Heisman Trophy in most national watch lists and polls due to his performance during the game combined with other Heisman frontrunners faltering.  On November 24, during the game against the Missouri Tigers before a home crowd, Manziel left the game with an apparent knee injury late in the first quarter. He returned to the field for the next series of downs wearing a knee brace and finished the game with 439 yards of total offense, including 3 passing and 2 rushing touchdowns. During the game, he broke the single season record for offensive production in the SEC with 4,600 yards, surpassing Cam Newton and Tim Tebow, notable recent Heisman Trophy winners. He also became the first freshman and only the fifth player in NCAA history to pass for 3000 and rush for 1,000 yards in a season, reaching that mark two games earlier than any other player. He won the SEC Freshman of the Year Award and College Football Performance National Freshman of the Year Award. Manziel won the Davey O'Brien Award on December 6 and the Heisman Trophy on December 8, making him the first freshman ever to win either award.

"Quick Question: Cinematographer Lee Garmes began the production, but on March 11, 1939 -- after a month of shooting footage that Selznick and his associates regarded as \"too dark\" -- was replaced with Ernest Haller, working with Technicolor cinematographer Ray Rennahan. Garmes completed the first third of the film -- mostly everything prior to Melanie having the baby -- but did not receive a credit. Most of the filming was done on \"the back forty\" of Selznick International with all the location scenes being photographed in California, mostly in Los Angeles County or neighboring Ventura County. Tara, the fictional Southern plantation house, existed only as a plywood and papier-mâché facade built on the Selznick studio lot. For the burning of Atlanta, new false facades were built in front of the Selznick backlot's many old abandoned sets, and Selznick himself operated the controls for the explosives that burned them down. Sources at the time put the estimated production costs at $3.85 million, making it the second most expensive film made up to that point, with only Ben-Hur (1925) having cost more.\n"

"Background: Anton Friedrich Wilhelm (von) Webern (German: ['anton 've:ban] ( listen); 3 December 1883 - 15 September 1945) was an Austrian composer and conductor. Along with his mentor Arnold Schoenberg and his colleague Alban Berg, Webern was in the core of those in the circle of the Second Viennese School, including Ernst Krenek and Theodor W. Adorno. As an exponent of atonality and twelve-tone technique, Webern exerted influence on contemporaries Luigi Dallapiccola, Krenek, and even Schoenberg himself.\n"
"Context: Webern published little of his early work in particular; like Brahms, though perhaps for not entirely the same reasons, Webern was characteristically meticulous and revised extensively. Many juvenilia remained unknown until the work and findings of the Moldenhauers in the 1960s, effectively obscuring and undermining formative facets of Webern's musical identity, highly significant even more so in the case of an innovator whose music was crucially marked by rapid stylistic shifts. Thus when Boulez first oversaw a project to record \"all\" of Webern's music, not including the juvenilia, the results fit on three rather than six CDs.  Webern's earliest works consist primarily of lieder, the genre that most belies his roots in Romanticism, specifically German Romanticism; one in which the music yields brief but explicit, potent, and spoken meaning manifested only latently or programmatically in purely instrumental genres; one marked by significant intimacy and lyricism; and one which often associates nature, especially landscapes, with themes of homesickness, solace, wistful yearning, distance, utopia, and belonging. Robert Schumann's \"Mondnacht\" is an iconic example; Eichendorff, whose lyric poetry inspired it, is not far removed from the poets (e.g., Richard Dehmel, Gustav Falke, Theodor Storm) whose work inspired Webern and his contemporaries Alban Berg, Max Reger, Arnold Schoenberg, Richard Strauss, Hugo Wolf, and Alexander Zemlinsky. Wolf's Morike-Lieder were especially influential on Webern's efforts from this period. But well beyond these lieder alone, all of Webern's music may be said to possess such concerns and qualities, as is evident from his sketches, albeit in an increasingly symbolic, abstract, spare, introverted, and idealized manner.  Other works include the orchestral tone poem Im Sommerwind (1904) and the Langsamer Satz (1905) for string quartet.  Webern's first piece after completing his studies with Schoenberg was the Passacaglia for orchestra (1908). Harmonically, it is a step forward into a more advanced language, and the orchestration is somewhat more distinctive than his earlier orchestral work. However, it bears little relation to the fully mature works he is best known for today. One element that is typical is the form itself: the passacaglia is a form which dates back to the 17th century, and a distinguishing feature of Webern's later work was to be the use of traditional compositional techniques (especially canons) and forms (the Symphony, the Concerto, the String Trio, and String Quartet, and the piano and orchestral Variations) in a modern harmonic and melodic language.\n"

"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?\n"
"While everyone relaxes differently, find something that works for you. You may try simply visualizing a calming scene, releasing tension in your muscles, practicing breathing, or meditation. Try to work on a relaxation technique that can be done anywhere at anytime. This way, when you encounter your phobia, you can overcome your fear. Be as detailed as possible and include all types of experiences, from the mildly anxious to terrifying. This will help you tackle your fear at a variety of levels. For example, if you are afraid of heights, you might encounter them in the following situations: hiking on a mountain, flying in an air plane, and going up a sky scraper in an elevator.  After compiling the list, you may notice similar variables between certain types of fear. For example, you may find that you have a terrifying reaction to flying and riding in an elevator. You may realize that both involve small spaces. If you have multiple phobias, such as snakes, spiders, and clowns, choose one to start with. It is easier to tackle one phobia at a time. Order your list of situations by how anxious or fearful they make you. Start your list with the situations that only make you mildly anxious or tense. Place the scariest situations towards the end of your list. For example, if you are afraid of dogs, your list might start off with simply looking at a picture of a dog, and progress to seeing a dog outside your window, across the street, and end with petting a large dog off its leash. Your list may not be very long or it can be incredibly lengthy. What matters is that you have a guide to deal with your phobia. You should start by visualizing the least upsetting item. Practice relaxing until you feel your muscles lose their tension. Once you've done this for a minute, take a break and repeat the exercise a few more times. Once you have mastered an item, move on to the next one until you've reached your most feared situation. Some items might take a lot longer to master than others. For example, you might get over looking at a picture of a spider a lot quicker than actually having to hold a spider in your hand. Don't be afraid to ask someone for help if you find yourself stuck, or unable to work through an item on your list. He or she may be able to help you work through your fear. Once you've worked through your situation list by visualizing and relaxing, find your phobia in real life. By now, you should be well trained in relaxing. Start with situations that produce little anxiety before encountering the scarier items on your list. Even once you've overcome your most dreaded fear, keep exposing yourself to it so that you don't let the fear return. This repeated exposure will allow you to manage your response. Perhaps one of the reasons you are so afraid of dogs is because you've had a bad experience with one as a child. Your mind held on to this, and turned it into a phobia. Once you conquered your fear of dogs and managed to pet a large dog without feeling anxious, go out and treat yourself. Have an ice cream cone or a fancy latte. Your mind may start to associate good things with the very thing you used to fear.\n"

"Title: Ancient Riverbeds on Mars: A Study of their Origins and Implications for Life\n"
"\n"
"Introduction\n"
"\n"
"The quest for understanding the history and potential habitability of Mars has captivated scientists and laypeople alike. The red planet has often been the subject of speculation about whether it could have once harbored life, a question that remains gripping as space agencies across the world continue to explore and investigate the mysteries of Mars. Recently, researchers have made a significant discovery that sheds new light on the planet's geological history.\n"
"\n"
"Ancient Riverbeds and Warm Spells on Mars\n"
"\n"
"In a groundbreaking study, scientists have determined that ancient riverbeds located in the Aeolis Dorsa region on Mars were likely created by periodic warm spells, which were in turn, caused by volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, and changes in the planet's orbit. These findings reinforce the idea that Mars has undergone dramatic environmental changes over its 4.6 billion-year history.\n"
"\n"
"The research, carried out by examining 3.6 billion-year-old craters in the Aeolis Dorsa region, has provided valuable insights into the climatic conditions of ancient Mars. The presence of these riverbeds indicates that significant water flow was present during the planet's early history, enabling these ancient rivers to carve their way through the martian landscape.\n"
"\n"
"The Role of Volcanic Eruptions, Asteroid Impacts, and Orbit Changes\n"
"\n"
"Scientists believe that the warm spells responsible for the flow of water on Mars were triggered by volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, and changes in the planetary orbit. The immense heat generated by volcanic eruptions and asteroid impacts would have melted subsurface ice, releasing vast quantities of water that flowed across the martian surface. Additionally, as Mars' orbit gradually shifted over time, periodic climatic fluctuations may have also caused changes in temperature, promoting the periodic formation of riverbeds.\n"
"\n"
"Limited Timeframe for Life\n"
"\n"
"While the discovery of ancient riverbeds suggests a wetter and more Earth-like past for Mars, researchers emphasize that these warm spells were relatively short-lived. The temporary nature of these warm periods would not have provided the necessary stable temperatures and water supply for the development of complex organisms. Consequently, despite the identification of ancient riverbeds, the likelihood that life once thrived on Mars remains speculative at best.\n"
"\n"
"Intriguingly, this study comes hot on the heels of another captivating mystery on Mars. Just weeks ago, a peculiar light was caught on camera by the Mars Curiosity rover, sparking widespread curiosity and generating further intrigue surrounding the red planet.\n"
"\n"
"Conclusion\n"
"\n"
"The discovery of ancient riverbeds on Mars provides a fascinating glimpse into the planet's past, when volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, and orbit changes created conditions favorable for water flow. While these warm spells were insufficient in duration to support life, the findings of this research continue to unlock new mysteries about Mars and its ancient geological history, fostering even greater interest in the ongoing exploration of our enigmatic planetary neighbor."

"The Arcus Foundation is a charitable foundation dedicated to promoting social justice and inclusion for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people worldwide. It aims to address the wide range of laws and policies that impact the LGBT community, which can vary significantly from one country or territory to another. Some of these laws address the legal recognition of same-sex marriages or partnerships, while others impose severe penalties for engaging in same-sex romantic or sexual activities, or for identifying as LGBT.\n"
"\n"
"The issues that the Arcus Foundation focuses on include, but are not limited to:\n"
"\n"
"1. Legal recognition of same-sex marriages and partnerships: This is an important aspect of LGBT rights, as it confers several benefits such as inheritance rights, pension benefits, healthcare benefits, and immigration rights to same-sex couples. In recent years, there has been an increasing number of countries that have legalized same-sex marriage or civil unions, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and several European countries.\n"
"\n"
"2. Anti-discrimination laws: Discrimination against LGBT individuals can manifest in various forms, such as in the workplace, educational institutions, and access to services. The Arcus Foundation supports efforts to establish and strengthen anti-discrimination legislation that protects the rights of LGBT people.\n"
"\n"
"3. Gender identity and expression: Transgender and gender non-conforming individuals face unique challenges and discrimination that often go beyond those faced by cisgender LGBT people. The Arcus Foundation supports initiatives that promote the rights of transgender individuals, including legal recognition of their gender identity and access to appropriate healthcare services.\n"
"\n"
"4. Decriminalization of homosexuality: In some countries, homosexuality is still criminalized, which means that same-sex sexual activity or relationships are illegal. Penalties for such acts range from fines and imprisonment to corporal punishment and even the death penalty. The Arcus Foundation works towards decriminalizing homosexuality worldwide, advocating for the abolition of these harmful laws and policies.\n"
"\n"
"5. Conversion therapy: Conversion therapy is a widely discredited practice that aims to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. The Arcus Foundation opposes conversion therapy and advocates for its ban in countries where it is still legal or practiced.\n"
"\n"
"6. Violence against the LGBT community: Many LGBT individuals face violence and hate crimes solely due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. The Arcus Foundation supports organizations and initiatives that work towards reducing violence and hate crimes against the LGBT community, such as through education, community outreach, and policy reforms.\n"
"\n"
"In summary, the Arcus Foundation is committed to supporting initiatives that address the diverse laws and policies affecting the LGBT community around the world, from legalizing same-sex marriage to eliminating discrimination and violence. By providing funding, resources, and advocacy, the foundation strives to create a more inclusive and just society where LGBT individuals can live freely and without fear."

"I remember a certain Tuesday, the morning of 18/6/02 to be exact. I was dozed off, trying to convince myself to get out of bed when a horrific explosion was heard. I went to the kitchen where I have a view of several neighborhoods in the southern Jerusalem and saw a pillar of smoke rising from a distant point, the sight of the smoke was followed a minute later by the waling of sirens. I remember rushing to my bedroom, taking out my binoculars, racing back to the kitchen and spotting the image of a glass shattered bus. The bus was still near the pick up station where a terrorist boarded on it and with a single click on a TNT device, murdered 25 passengers, many of whom were on their way to school. The wife of a good friend of mine, sat on the bus at the back row, a seemingly arbitrary and meaningless decision that saved her life.\n"

"I'm sure that every Israeli has at least one terror-related memory he wishes he never would have had and it was only a matter of time before someone made a film about it. As it turned out, the movie was about to become a repressed memory of its own.\n"
"\n"
"The film is about a play-write on a dry run, Haim Buzaglo (portrayed by, hmmm, Haim Buzaglo who also wrote and directed the film) that spends the better part of his day conducting staring contests with his blank word processor page. In the meantime, his girlfriend, a field reporter for the Israeli commercial channel, decides to make a piece about a debt ridden ex-army officer. Buzaglo, bored and a bit paranoid due what is medically known as the \"what on earth this hot babe is dating me\" syndrome, asks a private eye to conduct a stakeout on his girlfriend.\n"
"\n"
"As the detective progresses in his investigation, his observations are permeating into the play and later on, to the lives of its actors. In the meantime, the play metamorphoses from a comic play into an indictment against the aloofness of the Israeli society. As for the movie, well, the movie becomes an exercise in frenzy editing, ensconced in its petty cardboard characters and unreliable dialogs while drifting miles away from the subject it was supposed to deal with in the first place.\n"
"\n"
"When I say \"cardboard characters\" I refer to the characters that under the writer/director's obsession for a \"meaningful\" film, were devoid of any genuine dialogs and any shred of reliability. I won't elaborate too much about it. Suffice to say that I'm sure that homeless barefoot male prostitutes rarely go the theater. With the intention to see a play, that is.\n"
"\n"
"This movie, according to Haim Buzaglo himself is the first part of a current agenda trilogy. I sincerely hope that the other two films will be derived from the experiences like the one I wrote about in the beginning of my review as opposed to the secluded world of characters that are anything but existent and a plot that is anything but compelling.\n"
"\n"
"4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter.\n"
"\n"
"P.S. This movie was a landmark in austerity. It was shot in ten days, all the cast worked for free and the entire cost of the film was about 12,000$ (no, I didn't omit a zero or two, twelve thousand dollars). Makes you wonder why it took 34,000$ to complete Blair witch project.\n"

"Title: The Current State of Jordan's Bleak and Windswept Border with Iraq\n"
"\n"
"Introduction\n"
"\n"
"The boundary between Jordan and Iraq has historically been an essential conduit for bilateral trade, movement of people, and cultural exchanges. However, recent years have witnessed a dramatic decline in two-way traffic on this once bustling border. This article will explore the underlying reasons for the decline in border activity and its impact on the local communities in both Jordan and Iraq.\n"
"\n"
"The Deserted Landscape\n"
"\n"
"The once teeming border of Jordan and Iraq is now characterized by its desolation. The windswept desert dunes on both sides of the boundary have a bleakness that permeates deeper due to the drastic drop in border crossings. The scarcity of people and goods crossing the border is a striking change from what was previously a hub of activity amid the vast, uninviting terrain.\n"
"\n"
"Culprits behind the Decline\n"
"\n"
"Various factors have contributed to the dwindling of two-way traffic between Jordan and Iraq. Key causes include:\n"
"\n"
"1. Escalating security concerns: The emergence of extremist groups like ISIS in the region has led to widespread instability, spreading fear amongst individuals and businesses. The resulting militant clashes have rendered the borders unsafe and heavily militarized, discouraging people from traveling across the boundary.\n"
"\n"
"2. Economic downturn: The ongoing economic slowdown in both Jordan and Iraq, coupled with lower oil prices, has diminished the incentive for trade between the two countries. Moreover, global sanctions imposed on Iraq have further stifled the nation's ability to engage in cross-border commercial activity.\n"
"\n"
"3. The refugee crisis: The influx of refugees from war-torn countries such as Syria has put immense strain on Jordan's resources, leading the nation to enforce stricter border control measures to manage the situation.\n"
"\n"
"Impact on Local Communities\n"
"\n"
"The decrease in border traffic has left local communities on both sides of the boundary struggling to adapt. Many families who once relied on cross-border trade or tourism for their livelihood now find their businesses faltering. The lack of economic opportunities has led to increased unemployment, financial hardship, and even forced migration for some communities.\n"
"\n"
"Looking Forward\n"
"\n"
"Addressing the issues that have led to the deteriorating state of the Jordan-Iraq border is paramount for the future growth and stability of the region. Fostering a more secure environment by addressing extremist threats and regional instability is critical for restoring confidence in border crossings. Additionally, stimulating economic growth and lifting trade restrictions can help revive the moribund commercial activities between the two countries.\n"
"\n"
"Conclusion\n"
"\n"
"Jordan's bleak, windswept border with Iraq may currently be experiencing a low point in two-way traffic, but there is hope for improvement in the future. By tackling the security, economic, and humanitarian challenges present in the region, it is possible to rekindle the sense of vibrancy and cooperation that once existed between the two neighbors. Only by addressing these issues can the local communities rebuild and thrive again on both sides of the border."

"The move follows an investigation into Indonesian abattoirs by Australia's ABC broadcaster, which showed graphic footage of animals being mistreated.\n"
"It prompted a public outcry and demands for the government to act.\n"
"Last week, Canberra suspended exports to abattoirs shown in the programme, but now it has issued a blanket ban.\n"
"Indonesian officials have rebuffed claims of widespread animal cruelty in their abattoirs.\n"
"Bayu Krisnamurti, the Vice Minister of Agriculture, told the BBC that the coverage had created a negative perception of Indonesia overseas.\n"
"\"I think ABC practised unfair journalism, only the bad practices were portrayed. We see this as an isolated incident.\n"
"\"It's against the law in Indonesia to be so harsh and cruel to animals. Indonesian regulations explicity say we must practise animal welfare in handling animals in the slaughterhouse.\"\n"
"He acknowledged that it could hurt the country's ability to procure cattle. He said that New Zealand and the US were being looked at as possible alternative suppliers, but Jakarta had not yet contacted either.\n"
"The ban is the result of public revulsion and outrage at the gruesome footage from Indonesia's abattoirs that was broadcast last week in an ABC TV documentary, says the BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney.\n"
"It showed steers being whipped, beaten and slashed repeatedly, and suffering terrible pain before they are slaughtered.\n"
"Read more from Nick Bryant's blog\n"
"Australia first announced a ban on live exports to the 12 abattoirs featured in the programme.\n"
"But the public demanded more, signing online petitions to halt the trade with Indonesia and pressing lawmakers in Canberra to bring in a complete ban, our correspondent says.\n"
"Australia's Agriculture Minister Joe Ludwig said Canberra would impose a six-month initial suspension on shipments to Indonesia.\n"
"\"A sustainable live cattle export industry must be built on the ability to safeguard the welfare of the animals. The trade to Indonesia will only recommence when we are certain industry is able to comply with that.\"\n"
"Lyn White, who filmed the graphic images, and is the campaign director for Animals Australia, welcomed the move.\n"
"\"There has been an extraordinary outpouring of rage that our cattle have been treated like this and have been supplied for such treatment. So this is a first step,\" she told Australian television.\n"
"An early indication that a blanket ban was about to come into effect came on Tuesday, when about 2,000 cattle were not allowed to board a ship in Western Australia that was about to set sail for Indonesia.\n"
"Australia exports more than 700,000 cattle each year - the vast majority to Indonesia.\n"
"Australian farmers have warned that a ban would destroy many rural livelihoods. Butchers have already reported that beef sales are down by up to 15%.\n"
"But Luke Bowen from the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association said he accepted the government's action, even though it would prove costly.\n"
"\"It is going to hurt, we know that,\" he said. \"There's tens of thousands of cattle in the supply chains now. But we have to stay focused on the animal welfare outcome, and we're very encouraged by the government's commitment to the trade in the long term.\"\n"

"Wearing a pocket square was considered desirable by Robert but not Michael because the two of them had markedly different fashion sensibilities, value systems, and social contexts that influenced their personal preferences when it came to accessorizing and dressing up for formal occasions.\n"
"\n"
"For Robert, the pocket square was a significant aspect of his elegant, sophisticated style that he had cultivated over the years. He had a great appreciation for the finer things in life and took pride in ensuring that his outfits were meticulously coordinated and groomed to perfection. In his social and work circles, a well-dressed man donning suit with just the right pocket square was deemed to leave a remarkable impression and command respect among his peers.\n"
"\n"
"Robert strongly believed that wearing a pocket square demonstrated his attention to detail, refinement, and confidence, which played an essential role in his career progression. Moreover, he found great pleasure in experimenting with a wide variety of folds and colors to express his personality and refine his signature style. For him, the pocket square symbolized both a functional and a fashionable accessory: it not only allowed him to wipe his glasses or clean his smartphone screen but also allowed him to express his creativity in the choice of fabrics, textures, and patterns to complement his formal attire.\n"
"\n"
"Michael, on the other hand, had quite a different perspective when it came to fashion choices. He followed a more minimalist, understated approach to dressing. For him, the functionality and comfort of his clothing overruled any additional decorative elements such as a pocket square. He saw pocket squares as unnecessary, superfluous accessories that only served cosmetic purposes, without contributing much to practicality or the overall outfit.\n"
"\n"
"Moreover, Michael was always apprehensive that the addition of a pocket square would make him appear too flashy or overdressed, thereby drawing unwanted attention and discomfort. In his view, conserving a relaxed, informal, and unpretentious demeanor was his priority even at formal events. He was more likely to express his style and preferences through the quality of his suits, the fit of his shirt, and the choice of his tie, rather than indulging in any add-on elements.\n"
"\n"
"Besides, Michael's social and work circles did not assign tremendous importance to the finer details of formal dressing, so he felt no pressure to conform to the practice of wearing pocket squares despite their popularity among a certain demographic. Thus, Michael found it more aligned with his personal philosophy and ethos to avoid the use of pocket squares altogether, and instead, opted for a cleaner, subtle look that reflected his pragmatic and straightforward nature.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the desirability of wearing a pocket square in the given case depends largely on the individual's personal preferences, values, and social contexts that dictate their attitude towards accessories and fashion choices. While Robert saw it as a fashion enhancer that also conveyed sophistication and attention to detail, Michael considered it an unnecessary embellishment that complicated his otherwise streamlined and minimalist style."

"The Moody Blues are an English rock band formed in Birmingham, England in 1964. They first came to prominence playing rhythm and blues music, but their second album, Days of Future Passed, which was released in 1967, was a fusion of rock with classical music and established them as pioneers in the development of art rock and progressive rock. It has been described as a \"landmark\" and \"one of the first successful concept albums\". The band became known internationally with singles including \"Go Now\", \"Nights in White Satin\", \"Tuesday Afternoon\", and \"Question\".\n"
"\n"
"In the spring of 1974, after completing a vast world tour that culminated with a tour of Asia, the group took an extended break, erroneously reported as a break-up at the time, because of the other band members feeling exhausted and overshadowed (this was said by Hayward in the final issue of Higher & Higher magazine 2006). Although the band had typically featured four lead vocalists (with Edge also contributing vocally), Hayward was the principal guitarist/vocalist whilst Pinder was considered to be the person most responsible for their symphonic sound, arrangements, and overall conceptual direction. Pinder and Thomas also doubled as the Moodies' onstage MCs (as the 1969 \"Caught Live + 5\" album displayed).  Before the band's 1973-74 world tour (their last with Pinder), Hayward wrote a song called \"Island\" with the intention of including it on a potential follow-up album, which the Moodies recorded in 1973 before ultimately going their separate ways. An additional cause of the hiatus were the long tours that had by this time strained Pinder, who needed a rest. In 1974 the band oversaw preparation of the compilation album This Is The Moody Blues which was released that year.  Hayward and Lodge released a duo album, the very successful Blue Jays (1975), and a UK chart single, \"Blue Guitar\" (no. 8), which was credited to Hayward and Lodge even though it was just Hayward with 10cc backing him. The album had originally been a projected liaison between Hayward and Pinder, but after Pinder dropped out, John Lodge stepped in. (Tony Clarke produced it.) The members then released solo albums. Pinder said he hoped to get the band back together that year. \"Having moved to California in 1974, I returned to Britain for a visit in summer 1975. I was trying to get the band to do an album, but the response was so weak I returned to California with my two new Mk5 mellotrons and began work on my solo album The Promise.\" Edge produced two albums with guitarist Adrian Gurvitz, Kick Off Your Muddy Boots (1975) and Paradise Ballroom (1976); Hayward composed the acoustically textured Songwriter (1977), which was followed up in later years by Night Flight (1980), Moving Mountains (1985), (which Hayward dedicated to Peter Knight) Classic Blue (1989), The View From The Hill (1996) and Live in San Juan Capistrano (1998); Lodge released Natural Avenue (1977); Pinder produced The Promise (1976); and Thomas collaborated on two projects with songwriter Nicky James, producing From Mighty Oaks (1975) and Hopes, Wishes and Dreams (1976).\n"

"The given topic discusses the health condition of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader and former guerrilla fighter, who had for several decades been a symbol of the struggle for Palestinian statehood. Arafat, who served as Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and President of the Palestinian National Authority, suffered from an undetermined illness, which led to his slipping in and out of consciousness.\n"
"\n"
"Yasser Arafat had long been one of the most prominent figures in the Middle East, both as a leader of the Palestinian people and a key figure in the peace process with Israel. Born in Cairo in 1929, Arafat became involved in the Palestinian cause from a young age and eventually founded Fatah, a nationalist political party aimed at establishing an independent Palestinian state.\n"
"\n"
"Under Arafat's leadership, the PLO became the primary organization fighting for the rights of the approximately 9 million Palestinian people living in the Israeli-occupied territories of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. Negotiations with Israel were often contentious, but Arafat played a pivotal role in representing Palestinian interests and pushing for a viable two-state solution.\n"
"\n"
"In 1994, Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize along with Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres for their efforts to establish peace in the region through the Oslo Accords. Although the peace process faced several setbacks in the following years, Arafat remained a constant presence in the fight for Palestinian self-determination.\n"
"\n"
"In October 2004, Arafat's health began to decline rapidly, with the leader suffering from severe flu-like symptoms and the inability to keep food down. As his condition worsened, he was transferred from his besieged compound in Ramallah to a French military hospital for specialized medical treatment. While rumors circulated about the possible causes of his illness, ranging from food poisoning to a more grave condition, the exact nature of his ailment remained undiagnosed.\n"
"\n"
"The deterioration of Arafat's health obviously had significant implications for the Palestinian people and the future of the peace process. His absence from the helm of Palestinian politics left a vacuum that raised questions about who would emerge as the new leader and whether they would be able to continue Arafat's pursuit of a Palestinian state.\n"
"\n"
"As Arafat's condition worsened and he slipped in and out of consciousness, prayers for his recovery were held throughout Palestine, highlighting the deep connection many Palestinians felt toward their leader. Unfortunately, Arafat passed away on November 11, 2004, and his death marked the end of an era in the Palestinian struggle for statehood.\n"
"\n"
"To this day, Yasser Arafat remains a divisive figure in the Middle East, with some praising him as a freedom fighter and others denouncing him as a terrorist. Nevertheless, his impact on the Palestinian struggle for independence and the wider Middle Eastern peace process cannot be denied. His weakening health, as described in the statement, marked the beginning of a challenging period for Palestinian leadership and the ongoing quest for a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."

"The Sweet (also known as Sweet) is a British glam rock band that rose to worldwide fame in the 1970s. Their best known line-up consisted of lead vocalist Brian Connolly, bass player Steve Priest, guitarist Andy Scott, and drummer Mick Tucker. The group was originally called Sweetshop. The band was formed in London in 1968 and achieved their first hit, \"Funny Funny\", in 1971 after teaming up with songwriters Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman and record producer Phil Wainman.\n"
"\n"
"Guitarist Mick Stewart joined in 1969. Stewart had some rock pedigree, having previously worked with The (Ealing) Redcaps and Simon Scott & The All-Nite Workers in the mid-1960s. In late 1965, that band became The Phil Wainman Set when the future Sweet producer joined on drums and the group cut some singles with Errol Dixon. In early 1966, Stewart left and later worked with Johnny Kidd & The Pirates.  The Sweet signed a new record contract with EMI's Parlophone label. Three bubblegum pop singles were released: \"Lollipop Man\" (September 1969), \"All You'll Ever Get from Me\" (January 1970), and a cover version of the Archies' \"Get on the Line\" (June 1970), all of which failed to chart. Stewart then quit, and was not replaced for some time. Connolly and Tucker had a chance meeting with Wainman, who was now producing, and knew of two aspiring songwriters, Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, who were looking for a group to sing over some demos they had written together. Connolly, Priest and Tucker provided the vocals on a track called \"Funny Funny\" which featured Pip Williams on guitar, John Roberts on bass and Wainman on drums. The latter began offering the track to various recording companies. The band held auditions for a replacement guitarist and settled on Welsh-born Andy Scott. He had most recently been playing with Mike McCartney (brother of Paul) in the Scaffold. As a member of the Elastic Band, he had played guitar on two singles for Decca, \"Think of You Baby\" and \"Do Unto Others\". He also appeared on the band's lone album release, Expansions on Life, and on some recordings by the Scaffold. The band rehearsed for a number of weeks before Scott made his live debut with Sweet on 26 September 1970 at the Windsor Ballroom in Redcar.  The Sweet initially attempted to combine various musical influences, including the Monkees and 1960s bubblegum pop groups such as the Archies, with more heavy rock-oriented groups such as the Who. The Sweet adopted the rich vocal harmony style of the Hollies, with distorted guitars and a heavy rhythm section. This fusion of pop and hard rock would remain a central trademark of Sweet's music and prefigured the glam metal of a few years later.  The Sweet's initial album appearance was on the budget label Music for Pleasure as part of a compilation called Gimme Dat Ding, released in December 1970. The Sweet had one side of the record; the Pipkins (whose sole hit, \"Gimme Dat Ding\", gave the LP its name) had the other. The Sweet side consisted of the A- and B-sides of the band's three Parlophone singles. Andy Scott appears in the album cover shot, even though he did not play on any of the recordings.Answer this question using a quote from the following article:\n"

"b) All severe and unceasing restrictions on the freedoms of thought, conscience, religion, opinion, and expression, peaceful assembly, and association, and the access to information for everyone, as well as the limitations imposed on anyone who wishes to move freely within the country and travel abroad;\n"
"\n"
"In this context, the focus is on some of the fundamental human rights concerning individual liberties. The statement highlights the importance of ensuring that these rights are respected and protected, for they form the basis of a democratic and just society. Below is an analysis of the various freedoms mentioned in the statement and the implications of the restrictions on them.\n"
"\n"
"1. Freedoms of thought, conscience, and religion: These fundamental freedoms allow people to form, hold, and express their beliefs without fear of persecution or discrimination. They also encompass the freedom to change one's religion or belief and to practice one's faith in private and public. Restrictions on these freedoms may lead to severe consequences, such as limiting social, cultural, and intellectual progress, as well as fostering intolerance, enmity, and divisions within society.\n"
"\n"
"2. Freedom of opinion and expression: This right is directly related to the freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media, regardless of frontiers. Unceasing restrictions on this freedom may lead to censorship, the suppression of dissent, and a lack of transparency in governance, eventually resulting in a stifled democratic process, curtailed individual development, and diminished creativity.\n"
"\n"
"3. Freedom of peaceful assembly and association: The rights to gather peacefully, form associations, and express collective interests are essential to a vibrant civil society and function as a channel for public participation in decision-making processes. Limitations on these freedoms can limit the voice of the people, affect the balance of power, and lead to corruption and abuse of authority by those in positions of power.\n"
"\n"
"4. Access to information for everyone: Transparency and access to information are pivotal in building a well-informed and engaged populace. Restrictions on these aspects may lead to misinformation, concealment of illegal activities, and the obstruction of justice, creating an environment ripe for corruption and the infringement of human rights.\n"
"\n"
"5. Freedom of movement within the country and travel abroad: Ensuring the right to move without unjustified restrictions allows individuals to exercise their personal freedoms and contribute to the economic and social well-being of the nation. Restricting this freedom may result in negative impacts on freedom of choice, family unity, and cultural exchange, as well as limiting opportunities for education, work, and political participation.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, severe and unceasing restrictions on these fundamental rights can lead to significant detrimental effects on individuals and society as a whole. Upholding these freedoms is essential for fostering a democratic, just, and progressive society, where its members can pursue their personal and collective aspirations without fear or hindrance."

"Title: No Scrubs, Please\n"
"\n"
"Introduction:\n"
"\n"
"Many of us have heard the term \"scrub\" before, referring to an individual who may seem lazy, unambitious, or downright disrespectful. In this article, we will explore what it means to be a scrub, why it is important to avoid such behaviors, and how to cultivate better habits for personal and professional success. Let's dive into the world of no scrubs, please!\n"
"\n"
"Step 1: Define a scrub\n"
"\n"
"A scrub is a term that is often used to describe a person who lacks motivation, confidence, or respect for others. They may have poor social skills and demonstrate behaviors that are detrimental to their well-being or the well-being of those around them. It is important to recognize these traits in ourselves and others to ensure that we are promoting a positive and progressive environment.\n"
"\n"
"Step 2: Identify the reasons behind scrub behavior\n"
"\n"
"In order to combat scrub behaviors, it is important to first understand the reasons behind them. Scrubs may develop their habits due to various factors, including upbringing, social influences, or personal insecurities. Once we identify the root causes of these behaviors, it becomes easier to cultivate better habits and foster personal growth.\n"
"\n"
"Step 3: Highlight the consequences of scrub behavior\n"
"\n"
"Scrubs can inflict harm not only on themselves but also on the people around them. By displaying laziness, negativity, and disrespect, they may prevent themselves from reaching their full potential and hinder the growth of their peers. Additionally, scrub behaviors can lead to negative consequences in work and social settings, such as being passed up for job opportunities or facing social isolation.\n"
"\n"
"Step 4: Encourage self-reflection\n"
"\n"
"One of the most effective ways to address scrub behavior is through self-reflection. This means honestly evaluating one's own actions, attitudes, and beliefs to identify and rectify any areas where poor habits may be present. It's important to take personal responsibility for our behaviors and strive for continuous self-improvement.\n"
"\n"
"Step 5: Promote positive and respectful habits\n"
"\n"
"In order to move away from scrub behavior, it is essential to develop positive habits that foster personal and professional success. This includes practicing active listening, showing respect for others' opinions and beliefs, and fostering a growth mindset. These habits will not only benefit the individual but also contribute to a more positive and supportive environment.\n"
"\n"
"Step 6: Always maintain accountability\n"
"\n"
"Finally, it is important to always maintain accountability for one's actions and acknowledge when scrub-like behaviors may have resurfaced. This process of self-awareness and responsibility will ensure that individuals continue to grow and progress in their personal journeys toward better habits and attitudes.\n"
"\n"
"Conclusion:\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, by understanding the nature of scrubs and the reasons behind their behaviors, we can actively work to avoid them and promote a more positive environment. Through self-reflection, accountability, and cultivating positive habits, we can all move away from the scrub mentality and contribute to a world in which respect and growth are prioritized. Remember, no scrubs, please!"

"Richard of Bordeaux was the younger son of Edward, the Black Prince, and Joan of Kent. Edward, heir apparent to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War, particularly in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted dysentery in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year.\n"
"\n"
"Whereas the poll tax of 1381 was the spark of the Peasants' Revolt, the root of the conflict lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the Black Death and subsequent outbreaks of the plague. The rebellion started in Kent and Essex in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at Blackheath near London under the leaders Wat Tyler, John Ball, and Jack Straw. John of Gaunt's Savoy Palace was burnt down. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, who was also Lord Chancellor, and the king's Lord High Treasurer, Robert Hales, were both killed by the rebels, who were demanding the complete abolition of serfdom. The king, sheltered within the Tower of London with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate.  It is unclear how much Richard, who was still only fourteen years old, was involved in these deliberations, although historians have suggested that he was among the proponents of negotiations. The king set out by the River Thames on 13 June, but the large number of people thronging the banks at Greenwich made it impossible for him to land, forcing him to return to the Tower. The next day, Friday, 14 June, he set out by horse and met the rebels at Mile End. The king agreed to the rebels' demands, but this move only emboldened them; they continued their looting and killings. Richard met Wat Tyler again the next day at Smithfield and reiterated that the demands would be met, but the rebel leader was not convinced of the king's sincerity. The king's men grew restive, an altercation broke out, and William Walworth, the mayor of London, pulled Tyler down from his horse and killed him. The situation became tense once the rebels realised what had happened, but the king acted with calm resolve and, saying \"I am your captain, follow me!\", he led the mob away from the scene. Walworth meanwhile gathered a force to surround the peasant army, but the king granted clemency and allowed the rebels to disperse and return to their homes.  The king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at Billericay, he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt. Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the absolutist attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.\n"

"Jason Leonard  (born 14 August 1968) is an English former rugby union player, and has been the president of the Rugby Football Union since 2015. Nicknamed The Fun Bus, Leonard was a prop forward who won 114 caps for England and five for the British and Irish Lions. His total of 119 was a world record until 2006, when it was surpassed by George Gregan. Leonard played in England teams which won four Grand Slams (1991, 1992, 1995 and 2003) and the 2003 Rugby World Cup, and was part of the British and Irish Lions squad that won the test series during their 1997 tour of South Africa.\n"

"With Dick Best no longer England head coach, the RFU appointed well-known and highly successful Bath coach Jack Rowell as his replacement. There was much speculation amongst many established England players as to what changes the new coach would bring to the England setup, particularly one with such close ties to a successful Bath Rugby Club. Rowell claimed he would rid England of the cautious, forward-dominated 10-man game which had done so well for them earlier in the decade, and play running rugby more similar to Bath's. Leonard kept his place in the England team, which now included several new players such as Mike Catt, Ben Clarke, Victor Ubogu, Steve Ojomoh (all Bath players) and Tim Rodber. In the 1995 Five Nations, Leonard won a record (for a prop) 38th cap for England, playing against Scotland, and the victory meant his third Grand Slam.  England held high hopes for the upcoming Rugby World Cup in South Africa. At the World Cup, England were drawn in Pool B, generally regarded as one of the easier groups in the competition. However, England experienced setbacks, gaining only narrow victories over Argentina (24-18) and Italy (27-20). In England's final pool match against Western Samoa, Leonard was rested and his record of 40 consecutive England caps ended. England won that match 44-22 and also won the subsequent quarter-final against Australia 25-22, before losing the semi-final to New Zealand 29-45 and finishing the tournament in fourth place.  In November 1996, Leonard skippered England for the first time, against Argentina at Twickenham. The game was very close, with Argentina taking a narrow lead close to full-time. From a rolling maul, Leonard scored a try to level the scores, and a Mike Catt penalty won the game 20-18. The try remains Leonard's only score for England.  In the 1996-1997 season, Leonard began to play for England at tighthead prop (number 3) to make room for Leicester Tigers loosehead prop (number 1), Graham Rowntree, and in 1997, Leonard was selected for his second British and Irish Lions tour, this time to South Africa.  In September 1997, the RFU appointed Clive Woodward as head coach. The Autumn internationals saw England playing Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Against Australia, Leonard found himself selected at loosehead prop again, with Wasps' Will Green winning his first cap at tighthead. For the remaining two tests, Leonard was moved back to tighthead. The ability to scrummage effectively on either side of the scrum proved to be one of Leonard's great assets. Answer this question using a quote from the following article:\n"

"Title: Arsenal Eyes Villarreal's Gabriel Paulista As Potential Defensive Reinforcement\n"
"\n"
"Arsenal F.C., one of England's leading football clubs, is considering a strategic decision to boost their defensive lineup by acquiring Brazilian central defender Gabriel Paulista from the Spanish club, Villarreal C.F. Reports suggest that the club is ready to pay the £15.3 million release clause in Paulista's contract this transfer window, ensuring the stability and strength the team needs for the remainder of the season.\n"
"\n"
"The move is contingent on it being in the best interest of all parties involved. Villarreal seems open to negotiations, providing an excellent opportunity for the Gunners to strengthen their defense, which has been heavily reliant on Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker in recent times.\n"
"\n"
"Gabriel Paulista, a 29-year-old versatile player, has been a pivotal figure in Villarreal's 15-game unbeaten run across all competitions, showcasing top-notch performance and outstanding skills on the field. This run of form has seen the Spanish club rise to the top of their domestic league standings and become a serious contender in European competitions. The transfer of Paulista to the Premier League club would provide significant cover for Arsenal's defensive duo of Koscielny and Mertesacker, filling in any gaps left by the pair's injuries or suspensions.\n"
"\n"
"Arsenal's manager recognizes the need for reinforcements, as the team is currently fighting for both domestic and European glory. Despite being in the top four, Arsenal has faced criticism for their frailties at the back, which have sometimes derailed otherwise promising campaigns. By bringing in an accomplished player such as Paulista, the club seeks to address these concerns and create a formidable, well-balanced team capable of challenging for silverware on multiple fronts.\n"
"\n"
"The potential transfer of Gabriel Paulista to Arsenal also highlights the fluid nature of the transfer market, where clubs must be adaptable and strategic to remain competitive. By being ready and willing to part with the £15.3 million release clause, Arsenal demonstrates its intentions to be a force to reckon with in European football. The financial power of England's top clubs is often seen as a primary driver for securing talented players from across the globe, and this potential deal is yet another example of that trend.\n"
"\n"
"Fans and experts alike eagerly await the culmination of the deal, with supporters hoping that the addition of Paulista will propel Arsenal to new heights - both domestically and on the European stage. With several weeks remaining in the transfer window, the club has ample time to finalize negotiations, ensuring that the possible arrival of the Brazilian defender is a smooth and well-coordinated transition.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the proposed transfer of Gabriel Paulista from Villarreal to Arsenal offers an exciting prospect of further bolstering the English club's defensive capabilities. If successful, the deal would be a mutually beneficial arrangement, allowing Paulista to continue his career in one of the world's top leagues and providing Arsenal the necessary reinforcements to mount a strong challenge for titles in the coming months."

"Writing an article involves several steps, such as understanding the topic, researching, sorting out relevant data, and articulating them in a structured manner. In this case, the topic at hand involves historical events: the Battle of Poitiers and Edward's permission for John to return to Brittany.\n"
"\n"
"Step 1: Understand the Topic\n"
"Firstly, we need to clearly understand the task in hand. The user wants an article that answers the question of which event occurred first: the Battle of Poitiers, or Edward granting permission for John to return to Brittany. To write this article, we'll need to do research and determine the timings of these two historical events.\n"
"\n"
"Step 2: Research\n"
"The Battle of Poitiers refers to one of two major historical events – the Battle of Poitiers in 732 where Charles Martel stopped the Arab advance into Western Europe or the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 during the Hundred Years' War. Since we are comparing it with an event involving English and Breton nobility, it's likely the latter scenario, as the Hundred Years' War involved England and France.\n"
"\n"
"Edward, in this instance, likely refers to Edward I of England (reigned 1272-1307). John is presumably John I, Duke of Brittany (reigned 1237-1286). Research reveals that Edward I allowed John I to return to Brittany around 1274.\n"
"\n"
"Step 3: Analyze the Information\n"
"Upon analyzing the research data, it is seen that Edward I's permission to John to return to Brittany was in the 13th century, specifically around 1274, whilst the Battle of Poitiers relevant to the English monarchy took place in the 14th century, in 1356 to be precise.\n"
"\n"
"Step 4: Construct the Article\n"
"Now that we've gathered and analyzed the necessary data, it's time to write an article detailing the findings. I'll ensure the article is informative and organized, with a clear statement answering the initial question.\n"
"\n"
"Step 5: Proofread and Review\n"
"After writing the article, it's crucial to proofread for any potential errors and ensure the article is cohesive, relevant, and accurate.\n"
"\n"
"Here's how the article might look:\n"
"\n"
"Title: Which Happened First: The Battle of Poitiers or Edward Granting Permission to John to Return to Brittany?\n"
"\n"
"History is a grand tapestry, interwoven with countless threads of events. One might find themselves wondering about the sequence of past events, like the Battle of Poitiers and Edward's allowance for John to return to Brittany. This article clarifies which of these events happened first.\n"
"\n"
"To identify which occurred first, we first need to pinpoint the time frames of these events. The Battle of Poitiers involved in this comparison occurred during the Hundred Years' War in the year 1356. This was a decisive battle between the kingdoms of England and France. \n"
"\n"
"On the other hand, the event of Edward I, King of England, permitting John I, Duke of Brittany, to return to his dukedom is documented to have happened significantly earlier, around 1274, during Edward's reign.\n"
"\n"
"From the analysis, it becomes clear that Edward granting permission for John to return to Brittany happened first, predating the Battle of Poitiers by about 82 years. Therefore, even within the intricate panorama of history, chronology unravels the sequence of events."

"No, the statement \"Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs.\" does not correctly answer the question of what theory Erasmus Darwin outlined in the 1790s. Instead, this statement refers to Georges Cuvier's opposition to Erasmus Darwin's ideas about evolution and the development of species. To answer the question, we must first discuss the theory proposed by Erasmus Darwin and then briefly address how Georges Cuvier reacted to the theory.\n"
"\n"
"Erasmus Darwin, a British naturalist, scientist, and physician, formulated early ideas related to evolution in the 1790s, significantly predating the theories proposed by his grandson Charles Darwin. In his notable work \"Zoonomia; or the Laws of Organic Life\" (1794-1796), Erasmus Darwin outlined the concept of transmutation of species, hinting at the idea that species were not fixed but could change and evolve over time. Specifically, he suggested that all living organisms, including humans, had descended from a single common ancestor over millions of years, a process driven by environmental pressures and competition for resources.\n"
"\n"
"Erasmus Darwin's theory also included the idea of acquired characteristics, proposing that organisms could pass on traits they had acquired throughout their lifetime to their offspring, thus ensuring the improvement and adaptation of the species as a whole. This idea, which later came to be known as Lamarckism, after the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, was not universally accepted among scientists of the time.\n"
"\n"
"Georges Cuvier, a French naturalist, zoologist, and paleontologist, was a significant figure in the development of comparative anatomy and paleontology, and he strongly opposed the ideas put forth by Erasmus Darwin. Cuvier believed in the fixity of species, meaning that each species was created and remained unaltered throughout its existence. He argued that species' similarities were the result of their functional needs and the overarching design created by a higher power, rather than stemming from any shared evolutionary ancestry.\n"
"\n"
"Cuvier further contended that any drastic changes to an organism's morphology, as proposed by Erasmus Darwin, would render that organism unable to survive, reinforcing his stance on the immutability of species and the distinct separation between them. He sought to debunk the idea of evolution by showing that species were created with a specific, functional purpose, though his interpretation of the fossil record ultimately contributed to the eventual acceptance of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the statement provided does not directly answer the question about Erasmus Darwin's theory from the 1790s. Instead, the pertinent information would be that Erasmus Darwin proposed an early theory about the transmutation and evolution of species, suggesting that all living organisms descended from a single common ancestor and could pass on acquired characteristics to their offspring. Georges Cuvier contested this idea, emphasizing the fixity of species and their similarities due to functional requirements and intelligent design."

"Background: Robert Lee \"Bullet Bob\" Hayes (December 20, 1942 - September 18, 2002) was an Olympic sprinter turned American football wide receiver in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys. An American track and field athlete, he was a two-sport stand-out in college in both track and football at Florida A&M University. He has one of the top 100 meter times by NFL players. Hayes was enshrined in the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor in 2001 and was selected for induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in January 2009.\n"
"Context: At the 1964 Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, Hayes had his finest hour as a sprinter. First, he won the 100m and in doing so tied the then world record in the 100 m with a time of 10.06 seconds, even though he was running in lane 1 which had, the day before, been used for the 20 km racewalk and this badly chewed up the cinder track. He also was running in borrowed spikes because one of his shoes had been kicked under the bed when he was playing with some friends and he didn't realize until he got there. This was followed by a second gold medal in the 4x100 meter relay, which also produced a new World Record (39.06 seconds).  His come-from-behind win for the US team in the relay was one of the most memorable Olympic moments. Hand-timed between 8.5 and 8.9 seconds, his relay leg is the fastest in history. Jocelyn Delecour, France's anchor leg runner, famously said to Paul Drayton before the relay final that, \"You can't win, all you have is Bob Hayes.\" Drayton was able to reply afterwards, \"That's all we need.\" The race was also Hayes' last as a track and field athlete, as he permanently switched to football after it, aged only 21.  In some of the first meets to be timed with experimental fully automatic timing, Hayes was the first man to break ten seconds for the 100 meters, albeit with a 5.3 m/s wind assistance in the semi-finals of the 1964 Olympics. His time was recorded at 9.91 seconds. Jim Hines officially broke 10 seconds at the high altitude of Mexico City, Mexico in 1968 (and on a synthetic track) with a wind legal 9.95 which stood as the world record for almost 15 years. The next to surpass Hayes at a low altitude Olympics was Carl Lewis in 1984 when he won in 9.99, some 20 years later (though Hasely Crawford equaled the time in 1976).  Until the Tokyo Olympics, world records were measured by officials with stopwatches, measured to the nearest tenth of a second. Although fully automatic timing was used in Tokyo, the times were given the appearance of manual timing. This was done by subtracting 0.05 seconds from the automatic time and rounding to the nearest tenth of a second, making Hayes' time of 10.06 seconds convert to 10.0 seconds, despite the fact that the officials with stopwatches had measured Hayes' time to be 9.9 seconds, and the average difference between manual and automatic times was typically 0.15 to 0.20 seconds. This unique method of determining the official time therefore denied Hayes the record of being the first to officially record 9.9 seconds for the 100 meters. The first official times of 9.9 seconds were recorded at the \"Night of Speed\" in 1968.\n"

"Ernest Edward \"Ernie\" Kovacs (January 23, 1919 - January 13, 1962) was an American comedian, actor, and writer. Kovacs's visually experimental and often spontaneous comedic style influenced numerous television comedy programs for years after his death. Many individuals and shows, such as Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, Saturday Night Live, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Jim Henson, Max Headroom, Chevy Chase, Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, Captain Kangaroo, Sesame Street, The Electric Company, Dave Garroway, Uncle Floyd, and many others have credited Kovacs as an influence. Chevy Chase thanked Kovacs during his acceptance speech for his Emmy award for Saturday Night Live.\n"
"\n"
"Kovacs's father Andrew emigrated from Hungary at age 13. He worked as a policeman, restaurateur, and bootlegger; the last so successfully that he moved his wife Mary, and sons Tom and Ernie, into a 20-room mansion in the better part of Trenton.  Though a poor student, Kovacs was influenced by his Trenton Central High School drama teacher, Harold Van Kirk, and received an acting scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1937 with Van Kirk's help. The end of Prohibition and the Depression resulted in difficult financial times for the family. When Kovacs began drama school, all he could afford was a fifth floor walk-up apartment on West 74th Street in New York City. During this time, he watched many \"Grade B\" movies; admission was only ten cents. Many of these movies influenced his comedy routines later.  A 1938 local newspaper photograph shows Kovacs as a member of the Prospect Players, not yet wearing his trademark mustache. Like any aspiring actor, Kovacs used his class vacation time to pursue roles in summer stock companies. While working in Vermont during 1939, he became so seriously ill with pneumonia and pleurisy that his doctors didn't expect him to survive. During the next year and a half, his comedic talents developed as he entertained both doctors and patients with his antics during stays at several hospitals. While hospitalized, Kovacs developed a lifelong love of classical music by the gift of a radio, which he kept tuned to WQXR. By the time he was released, his parents had separated, and Kovacs went back to Trenton, living with his mother in a two-room apartment over a store. He began work as a cigar salesman, which resulted in a lifelong cigar-smoking habit.  Kovacs's first paid entertainment work was during 1941, as an announcer for Trenton's radio station WTTM. He spent the next nine years with WTTM, becoming the station's director of Special Events; in this job he did things like trying to see what it was like to be run over by a train (leaving the tracks at the last minute) and broadcasting from the cockpit of a plane for which he took flying lessons. Kovacs was also involved with local theater; a local newspaper published a photograph of him and the news that he was doing some directing for the Trenton Players Guild in early 1941. The Trentonian, a local weekly newspaper, offered Kovacs a column in June 1945; he named it \"Kovacs Unlimited\".\n"

"Despite the economic crisis, the number of women who own their own business or seek management positions in other places is increasing.\n"
"\n"
"In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of women who own their own businesses, as well as those who are seeking management positions in various sectors. This trend has persisted despite the challenges presented by economic crises, which have had a noticeable impact on the global job market and business landscape.\n"
"\n"
"There are several factors contributing to this rise in female entrepreneurship and leadership. Firstly, there is an overall increase in awareness and support for gender equality in the workplace, particularly in terms of access to opportunities and resources. This has been facilitated by legislative changes, industry policies, and the efforts of organizations and individuals advocating for greater gender diversity in leadership roles.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, women are becoming more educated and skilled, thus increasing their likelihood of being qualified for higher management positions. Many women are now pursuing advanced degrees in fields related to business and management, helping them develop the skills and expertise necessary to succeed in these roles.\n"
"\n"
"Another factor is the growing number of female role models in business. As more women take on leadership roles in various sectors, they demonstrate the success that can be achieved, inspiring others to follow in their footsteps. This contributes to a normalized view of women in leadership, encouraging even more women to pursue such opportunities.\n"
"\n"
"Moreover, with the advancements in technology, more women are finding it easier to start their own businesses, as many industries have become more accessible through platforms such as e-commerce, online marketing, and remote working arrangements. This has led to an increase in female entrepreneurs, who can now pursue their business goals and maintain a better balance between work and personal life.\n"
"\n"
"In addition, many women are attracted to entrepreneurship and management positions as a way to gain more control over their careers and achieve a better work-life balance. The flexibility offered by these roles allows women to prioritize both personal and professional goals, leading them to pursue these opportunities despite any economic uncertainties.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, economic crises may actually provide unique opportunities for women who are willing to take risks and innovate during challenging times. As traditional industries and businesses struggle, there could be room for enterprising women to step in and make a mark with innovative products, services, or business models.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the number of women owning their businesses and seeking management positions in other places has been on the rise, even in the face of economic crises. This is mainly attributable to increased support for gender equality, better education and skills, successful female role models, advancements in technology, and the desire for more control and flexibility in their careers. As this trend continues, it is likely to create a more diverse and inclusive business landscape and foster more opportunities for women to excel in leadership roles."

"The song's use of Indian and free-form jazz influences, along with its impressionistic lyrics, were immediately influential on the emerging genre of psychedelic rock. Accordingly, some authors and music historians, including Eric V. D. Luft, Domenic Priore, and Dwight Rounds, have described \"Eight Miles High\" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song. In his book Riot On Sunset Strip: Rock 'n' Roll's Last Stand in Hollywood, Priore cites \"Eight Miles High\" as being the record that kicked off the psychedelic craze, explaining \"prior to 'Eight Miles High,' there were no pop records with incessant, hypnotic basslines juxtaposed by droning, trance-induced improvisational guitar.\"  The song was responsible for the naming of the musical subgenre raga rock, when journalist Sally Kempton, in her review of the single for The Village Voice, used the term to describe the record's experimental fusion of eastern and western music. However, although Kempton was the first person to use the term raga rock in print, she had actually borrowed the phrase from the promotional material that the Byrds' press office had supplied to accompany the \"Eight Miles High\" single release. In a 1968 interview for the Pop Chronicles radio documentary, McGuinn denied that the song was in fact an example of raga rock, while Crosby, speaking in 1998, dismissed the term entirely, stating \"they kept trying to label us; every time we turned around, they came up with a new one ... it's a bunch of bullshit.\" Nonetheless, the experimental nature of the song placed the Byrds firmly at the forefront of the burgeoning psychedelic movement, along with the Yardbirds, the Beatles, Donovan and the Rolling Stones, who were all exploring similar musical territory concurrently.  Contemporary reviews for the single were mostly positive, with Billboard magazine describing the song as a \"Big beat rhythm rocker with soft lyric ballad vocal and off-beat instrumental backing.\" Record World magazine also praised the song, commenting \"It's an eerie tune with lyrics bound to hypnotize. Will climb heights.\" In the UK, Music Echo described the song as \"wild and oriental but still beaty\". The publication also suggested that with the release of \"Eight Miles High\" the Byrds had jumped ahead of the Beatles in terms of creativity, stating \"[By] getting their single out now they've beaten the Beatles to the punch, for Paul [McCartney] admitted recently that the Liverpool foursome are working on a similar sound for their new album and single.\" In recent years, Richie Unterberger, writing for the Allmusic website, has described \"Eight Miles High\" as \"one of the greatest singles of the '60s.\"  In 1999, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, an honor reserved for \"recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance that are at least 25 years old.\" In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked \"Eight Miles High\" at number 151 on their list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and in March 2005, Q magazine placed the song at number 50 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.\n"

"Mahayana Buddhism encourages everyone to become bodhisattvas. This branch of Buddhism is sometimes referred to as the \"Greater Vehicle\" because of its universal approach and its focus on the well-being of all sentient beings. The bodhisattva ideal is central to its teachings, promoting compassion, wisdom, and altruism. \n"
"\n"
"In Mahayana Buddhism, a bodhisattva is an individual who seeks to attain complete enlightenment (Buddhahood) for the benefit of themselves and all sentient beings. They make this commitment by taking the bodhisattva vow – a solemn promise to work tirelessly for the complete enlightenment and ultimate liberation of all beings, no matter how long it takes. This contrasts with the path of the Arhat in Theravada Buddhism, where the main goal is to reach individual enlightenment and liberation from the cycle of rebirth (samsara).\n"
"\n"
"The path of the bodhisattva is grounded in the practice of the six pāramitās or perfections. These are essential qualities that the aspirant must cultivate in order to progress on their spiritual journey. \n"
"\n"
"1. Dāna (Generosity): This encompasses the practice of giving selflessly to others, not only in terms of material possessions but also in terms of time, energy, and emotional support. Cultivating generosity helps to reduce attachment and selfishness, leading to a more open heart and compassionate outlook.\n"
"\n"
"2. Śīla (Moral Conduct): This perfection involves upholding moral precepts and engaging in ethical behavior in all aspects of life. It includes practicing right speech, right action, and right livelihood, which helps to create harmony and peace within oneself and the world.\n"
"\n"
"3. Kṣānti (Patience): Patience is essential for spiritual growth, particularly when faced with difficulties and challenges. It involves developing tolerance and equanimity towards oneself and others, as well as having the ability to accept and endure suffering without becoming bitter or resentful.\n"
"\n"
"4. Vīrya (Energy or Effort): This perfection involves constant diligence and effort in spiritual practice, maintaining enthusiasm and determination even in the face of obstacles. Sustained effort helps prevent laziness and stagnation, ensuring progress along the path.\n"
"\n"
"5. Dhyāna (Meditation or Concentration): Cultivating concentration and mindfulness through meditation practices helps to deepen insight and understanding of the nature of reality. A stable mind allows for the development of profound wisdom and strengthens the other perfections.\n"
"\n"
"6. Prajñā (Wisdom): The ultimate goal of Buddhist practice is to attain wisdom, or the direct understanding of the true nature of reality. This involves developing the right view and understanding of the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the interdependent nature of all phenomena (dependent origination).\n"
"\n"
"By practicing these perfections, bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhism gradually transform their minds and overcome the ignorance, craving, and aversion that keep them trapped in the cycle of samsara. This path leads to the complete awakening and enlightenment not only for oneself but for the benefit of all sentient beings, reflecting the compassionate spirit and all-encompassing vision of the Mahayana tradition."

"begins to glide independently on their skis, gaining confidence in their ability to balance and control their movements. A sense of joy and excitement emanates from the young child as they continue to ski down the slope, their eyes wide with wonder and a beaming smile plastered across their face. The parent, watching intently from behind, feels a mix of pride for their child's accomplishment and slight apprehension for their safety.\n"
"\n"
"As the young child continues to ski, they grow more comfortable and skillful with each passing moment. They start experimenting with different ski techniques, learning to transition from a snowplough (also known as a wedge) to parallel skiing. Little by little, as they gain more confidence, they begin to take on steeper and more challenging slopes.\n"
"\n"
"Meanwhile, the parent skis close behind, providing both guidance and encouragement to the child. Laughs and cheers of support echo across the snow-covered mountainside as the pair make their way down the slopes together. Other skiers and snowboarders passing by can't help but smile as they witness this heartwarming scene between parent and child.\n"
"\n"
"During their breaks, the parent takes time to explain essential skiing tips and techniques to the child, ensuring their understanding of safety precautions and how to control their descent on the slopes. The young child listens intently, occasionally interrupting with questions that display their eagerness to learn and improve.\n"
"\n"
"As the day progresses, the bond between parent and child becomes palpable, strengthened by their shared passion for skiing and newfound trust in one another's abilities. Together, they explore different parts of the ski resort, navigating through powdery snow-covered paths and weaving in and out of tree-lined trails. They create lasting memories to cherish, immortalized in photos and short video clips captured during their adventure.\n"
"\n"
"By the end of the day, the young child can undoubtedly call themselves a skier. Exhausted but fulfilled, both parent and child return to the ski lodge with stories of triumphs and minor mishaps to share with family and friends. As they recount their adventures, it becomes clear that the most significant victory of all is the time spent together and the bond that has formed between them.\n"
"\n"
"In the years that follow, the parent and child continue their skiing journey, exploring new destinations and challenging slopes. Skiing transforms from a casual pastime into a passion that both individuals share, creating a unique connection that transcends their day-to-day lives. From this initial experience on the slopes, the child learns valuable life lessons in perseverance, resilience, and the importance of overcoming challenges. As they mature and grow older, these qualities, forged during those early days skiing with their parent, will undoubtedly shape them into a more well-rounded and accomplished person.\n"
"\n"
"In this rather wholesome, moving scene, the act of skiing becomes not just a recreational activity, but a special bond between parent and child. This experience serves as a meaningful reminder of the invaluable power of shared interests and the lasting impact they can have on one's life and relationships."

"Background: Jacqueline Fernandez (born 11 August 1985) is a Sri Lankan actress, former model, and the winner of the Miss Sri Lanka Universe pageant of 2006. Born into a multiracial family of Canadian, Sri Lankan and Malaysian descent, Fernandez was raised in Bahrain. After graduating in mass communication from the University of Sydney and working as a television reporter in Sri Lanka, she joined the modeling industry. She was crowned the Miss Sri Lanka Universe 2006, and represented her country at Miss Universe 2006.\n"
"Context: Fernandez shares a close bond with her family, and admits that she misses being around them. She says: \"I miss them so much everyday. You don't realise when you live away from home how difficult life can be [...] At the same time, staying away from them has taught me to be more responsible. It has taught me so many things about myself, about priorities and time management.\" In March 2012, Fernandez turned vegetarian for a 40-day period to observe Lent, a period from Ash Wednesday to Holy Saturday.  In 2008, Fernandez started dating Bahraini prince Hassan bin Rashid Al Khalifa, whom she met at a mutual friend's party; they separated in 2011. While filming Housefull 2 in 2011, Fernandez began a romantic relationship with director Sajid Khan. The relationship attracted media coverage in India and there was speculation of an impending wedding. However, the relationship ended in May 2013.  In addition to acting in films, Fernandez has supported charitable organisations and a number of causes. In 2011, on the behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), she sent a letter to the Mumbai Municipal Commissioner asking for an end to horse-drawn carriage rides in Mumbai. In early 2013, she asked the consulate general of the Philippines, William John T Perera in Colombo, to hasten the transfer of an elephant from its inadequate housing at the Manila Zoo to a humane sanctuary. Later that year, she auctioned a breakfast in Mayfair, London, where she raised around PS4000 for the Pratham NGO, which helps children's primary education. In 2014, Fernandez was named \"Woman Of The Year\" by PETA (India) for advocating the protection of animals. The following year, she auctioned her outfits on an online portal for a philanthropic cause. Some of her outfits included the ones she wore in the song \"Party On My Mind\" (from Race 2) and \"Hangover\" (from Kick). In March 2016, she was part of \"Jacqueline Builds\" campaign that raised funds for the victims of the 2015 South Indian floods. In April 2017, Jacqueline Fernandez collaborated with Rakyan Beverages by investing in their juice products.  Fernandez has participated in several concert tours and televised award ceremonies. In 2013, she performed at the Temptations Reloaded in Auckland, Perth, and Sydney alongside Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukerji, and Madhuri Dixit. She also performed at the live talent show \"Got Talent World Stage Live\" with Khan, Priyanka Chopra and Varun Dhawan the following year. In July 2014, Fernandez opened a restaurant in Colombo, Kaema Sutra, in collaboration with chef Dharshan Munidasa, which specialises in contemporary Sri Lankan cuisine.\n"

"There are multiple factors that prevent a group of well-intentioned billionaires from pouring €10B into Greece's banks to save the country and Greeks from financial collapse. Here are some of the key reasons:\n"
"\n"
"1. Legal restrictions: International financial regulations, as well as regulatory laws in respective billionaires' countries, may limit the transfer of such large sums of money into another country's banks. These regulations are in place to curb money laundering, tax evasion, and other illicit financial activities.\n"
"\n"
"2. Moral hazard: Introducing a large sum of money to a country's banks to alleviate financial collapse could inadvertently encourage riskier behavior in the future. Banks may take more risks, knowing that they may be bailed out by outside sources if a crisis occurs again.\n"
"\n"
"3. Economic repercussions: Injecting €10B into Greece's banks could lead to inflation, as the country experiences a sudden influx of money. This could hurt the overall economic situation in the country and be counterproductive to the intended goal of stabilizing Greece's financial condition.\n"
"\n"
"4. Political considerations: A large influx of money from private individuals could create or perpetuate the idea of dependence on external forces for financial stability. This could lead to political disagreements within Greece and potential resentment toward the donating billionaires, as their actions could be perceived as interfering with Greece's autonomy.\n"
"\n"
"5. Return on investment: Billionaires would likely consider the potential return on investment (ROI) before deciding to inject funds into Greece's banks. It may not be an appealing investment opportunity if the overall financial condition of the country is unstable, as the chances of getting a substantial ROI could be low.\n"
"\n"
"Regarding your second question about taking a mortgage on your house in a Greek bank hoping for a Grexit, there are several issues to consider:\n"
"\n"
"1. Risk: Taking a mortgage from a Greek bank involves a high degree of risk, especially considering the unstable financial environment in Greece. This may not be a wise financial decision, as there is no guarantee of a Grexit, and the potential consequences could have a lasting negative impact on your finances.\n"
"\n"
"2. International regulations: There are likely regulations and policies in place that govern international mortgages, which could make it difficult or impossible for you to secure a mortgage with a Greek bank while residing in Belgium.\n"
"\n"
"3. Cross-border complexities: Securing a mortgage in a foreign country can be complicated due to differences in regulations, legal systems, and consumer protection laws. This may increase the financial burden and complexity of managing the mortgage, as well as the overall risks associated with your investment.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, these two questions are not the same. The first question deals with the potential actions of a group of billionaires that could potentially save Greece from financial collapse. The second question focuses on an individual seeking a mortgage from a Greek bank, possibly hoping to gain an advantage in the event of Greece's exit from the European Union. Therefore, the correct answer to your multi-choice problem is (a) no."

He had previously served as the Prime Minister twice in the 90s (1990-93 and 1997-99) and the Chief Minister of Punjab from 1985 to 1990. He is Pakistan's longest-serving prime minister.

"On 7 November 1990, the newly elected prime minister announced his nuclear policy and in public television, Sharif responded that: \"The peaceful [atomic] programme of which... it would be accelerated to accommodate growing [nuclear] [e]nergy needs and to make up for rising [oil] prices. And, of course, (Pakistan) will to construct new nuclear power plants.\" On 26 November, Sharif authorised talks with the US to solve the nuclear crises after the US had tightened its embargo on Pakistan, prompting Sharif to send his government's Treasure Minister Sartaj Aziz to held talks on Washington. It was widely reported in Pakistan that the US Assistant Secretary of State Teresita Schaffer had told the Foreign Minister Shahabzada Yaqub Khan to halt the uranium enrichment programme.  In December, France's Commissariat a l'energie atomique agreed to provide a commercial 900MW power plant, but plans did not materialise as France wanted Pakistan to provide entire financial funds for the plant. On December, the financial embargo was placed and the country's economy felt a distress that prompted Sharif to replace his Treasure minister. Sharif then used Munir Ahmad Khan to have convinced IAEA to allow Pakistan for a nuclear plant in Chashman where Khan intensively lobbied in IAEA for the nuclear power plant. In December 1990, IAEA allowed Pakistan to established CHASNUPP-I, signed with China; the IAEA also gave approval of upgrading of the KANUPP-I in 1990. During his first term, Sharif intensified his non-nuclear weapon policy and strictly followed the policy of deliberate nuclear ambiguity which was also continued by Benazir as well. Responding to US embargo, Sharif publicly announced that: \"Pakistan possessed no [atomic] bomb... Pakistan would be happy to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) but it must be provided \"first\" to India to do the same.\"  Sharif intensified his move to enhance the Pakistan's integrated nuclear development and authorised projects that seemed to be important in his point of views. Sharif also promoted the peaceful nuclear energy programme, and signed the CHASNUPP-I reactor with People's Republic of China for the commercial electricity use. Sharif also responded to use the nuclear development in more of economical usage, benefited for the country's economy and its extension to the civil society. His policies to make the nuclear program for economical use was also continued by Benazir Bhutto and Pervez Musharraf.\n"

"In the last couple of years the selfie has seen a meteoric rise to fame and was even given the Royal Seal of approval during the Commonwealth Games when some opportunistic youngsters managed to take one with her Majesty in the background. But now there is a new way to document your day – the dronie, where all of your photos are taken by a drone. French drone manufacturer Parrot say the increasingly popular method of using a remote controlled miniature aircraft is down to 'narcissism' - as people are buying them ready fitted with cameras in order to film themselves. Forget selfies - people are now using drones to take photos and videos, like this couple in Portugal. Up to 30,000 of the remote-controlled devices are predicted to have been sold by the end of this year. Drones are also increasingly being used at weddings, giving the bride and groom high-quality footage of their big day from an aerial perspective. Henri Seydoux, Parrot’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that the drones of the future will be able to pilot themselves, automatically following their subject around. He told the paper: ‘It would be like having a full TV crew with you when you went snowboarding or mountain climbing.’ He said that sales of drones jumped by 130 per cent in the third quarter of the year, taking the company by surprise. A woman gets her photo taken by a remote controlled flying dronie in a snow covered New Zealand. A group of brave adventurers had this picture taken by a dronie in Costa Rica as they crossed a rope bridge. Mr Seydoux added: ‘It turned out that in reality people bought the drones because of narcissism. ‘People want to put pictures on YouTube of them looking strong and talented, and that is why people want the cameras.’ However, last month it was revealed a passenger plane had a near miss with a drone as it landed at Heathrow, in the first such incident recorded at Britain’s biggest airport. The incident involved an Airbus A320, which can carry up to 180 passengers, and was rated by investigators as among the most serious near-collisions. The aircraft was at just 700ft at 2.16pm on July 22 when the pilot saw the drone, which had not shown up on air traffic control radar. He reported the sighting and an inquiry was launched by the UK Airprox Board, which investigates all reported near-misses. Investigators, however, were unable to identify it. It comes amid concern over the threat to aircraft from domestic drones flown by amateurs - especially as they are expected to be a must have Christmas present this year. Drones cost from as little as £35 - and sales have jumped thanks to extra demand. It is estimated that more than 30,000 drones will have been bought by British consumers by the end of the year — a high proportion of them as Christmas presents. The electronics chain Maplin says that sales within its stores are up 300 per cent on 2013. Last month, a conference on unmanned aerial systems in London heard that police were worried about injuries and other problems on Boxing Day when amateur ‘pilots’ try out their new drones. This group of friends and their dogs shot a video on a dronie of their walk up Bernal Hill in San Francisco.\n"

"\n"
"Whether shadow-boxing or using a speed bag or heavy bag, new boxers must concentrate on using proper form when unleashing a blow. Using proper form means that you’ll need to develop a good sense of balance so that you’re not thrown off balance by throwing a punch. Also, practice keeping your hands in front of your face and returning to this defensive position after throwing a punch.  Before punching, keep your hands close to your face and your elbows tight against your body. Put your weight into the punches you throw, and follow through with each punch. This will help you land punches effectively and accurately on your opponent’s head or torso. at your opponent to keep them at a distance. Jabbing is a basic punch which you’ll usually do with your weaker front hand. The jab is a short punch. To jab, drive your fist straight into your opponent’s face or torso. To maximize the effectiveness of the jab, professional boxers twist their arm and wrist just before making contact with their opponent. As opposed to a jab, which is thrown straight in front of the body, deliver a cross punch by jabbing your dominant hand in a slightly upward motion across your body. If your opponent throws a left jab at you, they’ll leave themself open for your right hook. Keep your weight on the balls of your feet, and aim your punch across your body towards the right side of your opponent’s torso or face.  Use the cross on its own to counter a jab, or put the jab and cross together for a 1-2 combo. The shoulder helps power the cross punch. Also pay attention to your feet when throwing a cross. As you throw the punch, move your body weight from your rear foot up to your front foot. The hook can be delivered to the head or body of the opponent. Lean your body to the side that you plan to hit from, and circle your arm around to punch the opponent in the unprotected side of their head or body. The hook is often used in combination with other punches.  The hook’s sweeping delivery is its chief drawback, as it can leave you susceptible to a counterpunch. So, if you and your opponent are exchanging swift jabs back and forth, this isn’t the time to wind up for a hook. The uppercut is an upward blow unleashed by either hand that is highly effective when in close quarters. Throw an uppercut when you’re close to your opponent’s body. To uppercut, lower your arm to about waist-height, then swing it upward in an explosive burst. Aim to his your opponent squarely on their chin. Don’t try to throw an uppercut form more than 1 foot (0.30 m) away, or you may miss and leave yourself open to a counter-attack to your body. After they become adept at delivering a variety of punches, fighters usually develop combinations, in which they release a devastating flurry of blows on their opponent. The first combination most boxers learn is the 1-2 combo (a jab followed by a cross). Try putting together different combos of your own. Rely on building combos around punches that you feel good throwing. Another effective combo adds a hook to the 1-2 combo.  If you're right-handed, this would be a left jab followed by a right cross and ending with a left hook.\n"

"Both families had their distinct traditions, but what made it special was the deep friendship between Katrina and Tanya despite these differences. However, this year was slightly different, as Tanya's family decided to invite Katrina's family to their home to celebrate Hanukkah together. This made Katrina not only excited but also a little nervous as she did not know much about Hanukkah traditions.\n"
"\n"
"Before going into the story, let's establish the background for our two main characters:\n"
"\n"
"[+] Katrina practices Judaism; \n"
"[+] Tanya practices Judaism.\n"
"\n"
"Since both Katrina and Tanya practice Judaism, it was not odd for them to share their cultural practices. This year's joint celebration would be a heartwarming experience where both families could learn more about each other's customs, embrace the similarities, and respect the differences.\n"
"\n"
"As the day approached, Katrina and her family decided to do some research to learn about Hanukkah, its rituals, and the traditional food served during the eight-day celebration. They wanted to be prepared and respectful when participating in the festivities with Tanya's family.\n"
"\n"
"On the first night of Hanukkah, Katrina's family arrived at Tanya's house, bringing some traditional Christmas treats as a gesture of goodwill. Tanya's family warmly welcomed them, and the two families began their evening by lighting the menorah together.\n"
"\n"
"Step 1: Lighting the Menorah\n"
"The families gathered to light the menorah. Tanya's father handed Katrina's father the shamash, the special candle used to light the other candles on the menorah. This was an opportunity for both families to bond while participating in an important Hanukkah ritual.\n"
"\n"
"Step 2: Reciting prayers\n"
"While lighting the menorah, Tanya's mother led the families in reciting the Hanukkah blessings. Katrina's family listened carefully and tried their best to follow along, showing their respect for Tanya's family's traditions.\n"
"\n"
"Step 3: Sharing the Meal\n"
"After lighting the menorah and reciting the prayers, it was time for dinner. Tanya's family had prepared various traditional Hanukkah dishes, such as latkes and sufganiyot. They explained the significance of these dishes to Katrina's family, and everyone sat down to enjoy the delicious food.\n"
"\n"
"Step 4: Playing Dreidel\n"
"As the meal came to an end, Tanya suggested playing the dreidel game, a traditional Hanukkah activity. Tanya's family taught Katrina's family the rules, and everyone got involved in the game, laughing and having a great time.\n"
"\n"
"Step 5: Gift Exchange\n"
"As a way to combine the two celebrations and show appreciation for each other's traditions, the families decided to have a small gift exchange. Katrina's family gifted Tanya's family a lovely set of Christmas ornaments, while Tanya's family gave Katrina's family a beautiful menorah.\n"
"\n"
"This year's combined celebration of Hanukkah and Christmas was a unique and meaningful experience for both families. By embracing each other's traditions, they not only deepened their friendship but also enriched their understanding of each other's beliefs. As they vowed to continue such gatherings in the future, the bond between Katrina and Tanya grew stronger, and the love and respect between their families blossomed."

"Title: A Nation Mourns the Loss of A Promising Cricketer - Phillip Hughes, Gone Too Soon\n"
"\n"
"Tragedy struck the world of Cricket last week as Phillip Hughes, aged 25, lost his life playing the game he loved. Hughes was playing in a Sheffield Shield match, representing South Australia against his former team New South Wales, when he was struck in the neck by a bouncer. The devastating incident has left Australia, and the world of cricket, mourning the loss of a young talent - someone who lived for the sport.\n"
"\n"
"Prime Minister Tony Abbott expressed his profound grief at the untimely passing of Phillip Hughes, stating that it is a sorrowful time for Australia and the global cricket fraternity. He emphasized that people should not have to face death while playing a sport that is considered a national treasure. Abbott paid tribute to the young cricketer who 'left us too soon'. The Premier's reaction is shared by the heartbroken nation, as well as others around the world, who are struggling with the loss of a talented individual who had touched many lives.\n"
"\n"
"Bill Shorten, the leader of the Australian Labor Party, also shared his condolences on this tragic event. He mentioned that Phillip Hughes was well-respected and loved not only by his teammates but also by his opponents. The young cricketer left a lasting impression on everyone who had the privilege of being a part of his journey. His presence on the field, as well as his humble and compassionate attitude off the field, made him a role model for many aspiring cricketers.\n"
"\n"
"Phillip Hughes' passing has raised eyebrows on player safety and the overall rules and regulations of the sport. Cricket, like all other sports, carries inherent risks, but this incident has brought to light these issues in a heartrending manner. As the cricketing community grapples with the enormity of this tragedy, there have been suggestions that the sport needs to take more steps to protect its players from such potentially fatal accidents.\n"
"\n"
"Meanwhile, tributes have poured in from across the globe. Cricketers, both past and present, as well as fans, celebrities, and politicians, have taken to social media to express their shock and sorrow. Many have shared their personal memories of Hughes, who represented not only his country but also the spirit of the game.\n"
"\n"
"Phillip Hughes amassed 1,535 runs at an average of 32.65 in 26 Test matches for Australia. One of his most memorable achievements came in 2009 when, at the age of 20, he became the youngest player ever to score back-to-back centuries in a Test match. His untimely demise has left a void in the cricketing world that will be difficult to fill.\n"
"\n"
"As Australia and the cricketing world come to terms with this loss, Phillip Hughes' life and accomplishments will not be forgotten. A spirited player who always played the game with passion and dedication, he embodied the enduring spirit of cricket. In his short yet illustrious career, Hughes left a lasting impact on the sport and its fans. His passing is a stark reminder that even amidst the spirit of competition, sportsmanship, and camaraderie that characterise the game, life can be fragile. Rest in peace, Phillip Hughes - a shining star who will be sorely missed."

"Former supermodel Janice Dickinson has accused Bill Cosby of sexually assaulting her.\n"
"\n"
"The 59-year-old \"America's Next Top Model\" judge told Entertainment Tonight the 77-year-old TV legend raped her more than two decades ago.\n"
"\n"
"Dickinson claimed that in 1982, Cosby invited her to Lake Tahoe, where he was performing, to discuss a job he had offered her, as well as advice on her singing career.\n"
"\n"
"She said that after she arrived in Tahoe, the two had dinner, and then when the two returned to her room, Cosby gave her “wine and a pill.”\n"
"\n"
"“The next morning I woke up and I wasn’t wearing my pajamas,” she said. “And I remember before I passed out that I had been sexually assaulted by this man.”\n"
"\n"
"“Before I woke up in the morning, the last thing I remember was Bill Cosby, in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and getting on top of me.”\n"
"\n"
"When asked if she ever confronted the TV star about what happened, she said that she had not, and that Cosby had never broached it with her.\n"
"\n"
"“I’ll tell you why I’m doing this,\" Dickinson said. “Because it’s the right thing to do, and it happened to me, and this is the true story.”\n"
"\n"
"Dickinson is the self-proclaimed \"world's first supermodel\" who claims to have coined the term during her covergirl heyday in the 70s and 80s.\n"
"\n"
"She's remained in the public eye over the past decade by appearing on several reality TV shows, including \"The Surreal Life,\" \"The Janice Dickinson Modelling Agency,\" and \"Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew,\" where she confronted addictions to prescription pills, and plastic surgery.\n"
"\n"
"Dickinson is the third accuser to come forward since comedian Hannibal Buress called Cosby a rapist during a stand-up routine in Philadelphia last month.\n"
"\n"
"The latest accuser before Dickinson, Joan Tarshis, went public over the weekend.\n"
"\n"
"In an essay published Sunday on the Hollywood Elsewhere website and an interview with CNN, Tarshis claimed that Cosby raped her in the autumn 1969, when she was a starstruck 19-year-old aspiring actress.\n"
"\n"
"Tarshis claimed Cosby lured her to his bungalow at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, drugged her and then forced her to perform oral sex on him.\n"
"\n"
"Tarshis said Cosby attacked her again days later at the Sherry Netherland hotel, after she accompanied him to a performance he gave at The Westbury Music Theater on Long Island.\n"
"\n"
"Last week, another woman, Barbara Bowman, published a first-person story in The Washington Post alleging that Cosby raped her in 1985 when she was 17.\n"
"\n"
"Bowman's story hit some of the same notes as Tarshis'; she said Cosby drugged her at his New York City brownstone and she recalled coming to \"in my panties and a man's t-shirt, and Cosby was looming over me.\"\n"
"\n"
"Both Joan Tarshis (l.) and Barbara Bowman have come forward with allegations against Bill Cosby.\n"
"\n"
"Cosby has never been criminally charged for any of the alleged sexual assaults.\n"
"\n"
"However, he did settle a civil case in 2006 brought by Temple University employee Andrea Constand who originally claimed he drugged and groped her in his mansion.\n"
"\n"
"Cosby's lawyer John Schmitt issued a statement that dismissed Tarshis and Bowman's claims as \"decade-old, discredited\" allegations.\n"

"Murray Newton Rothbard (; March 2, 1926 - January 7, 1995) was an American heterodox economist of the Austrian School, a historian, and a political theorist whose writings and personal influence played a seminal role in the development of modern right-libertarianism. Rothbard was the founder and leading theoretician of anarcho-capitalism, a staunch advocate of historical revisionism, and a central figure in the twentieth-century American libertarian movement.\n"
"\n"
"Murray Rothbard's parents were David and Rae Rothbard, Jewish immigrants to the U.S. from Poland and Russia, respectively. David Rothbard was a chemist. Murray attended Birch Wathen, a private school in New York City. Rothbard later stated that he much preferred Birch Wathen to the \"debasing and egalitarian public school system\" he had previously attended in the Bronx.  Rothbard wrote of having grown up as a \"right-winger\" (adherent of the \"Old Right\") among friends and neighbors who were \"communists or fellow-travelers.\" Rothbard characterized his immigrant father as an individualist who embraced the American values of minimal government, free enterprise, private property, and \"a determination to rise by one's own merits\". \"[A]ll socialism seemed to me monstrously coercive and abhorrent.\"  He attended Columbia University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and, eleven years later, his PhD in economics in 1956. The delay in receiving his PhD was due in part to conflict with his advisor, Joseph Dorfman, and in part to Arthur Burns rejecting his doctoral dissertation. Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. It was only after Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors that Rothbard's thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate. Rothbard later stated that all of his fellow students there were extreme leftists and that he was one of only two Republicans on the Columbia campus at the time.  During the 1940s Rothbard became acquainted with Frank Chodorov and read widely in libertarian-oriented works by Albert Jay Nock, Garet Garrett, Isabel Paterson, H. L. Mencken and others, as well as Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises. In the early 1950s, when Mises was teaching at the Wall Street division of New York University Business School, Rothbard attended Mises' unofficial seminar. Rothbard was greatly influenced by Mises' book, Human Action. Rothbard attracted the attention of the William Volker Fund, a group that provided financial backing to promote various \"right-wing\" ideologies in the 1950s and early 1960s. The Volker Fund paid Rothbard to write a textbook to explain Human Action in a form which could be used to introduce college undergraduates to Mises' views; a sample chapter he wrote on money and credit won Mises's approval. For ten years, Rothbard was paid a retainer by the Volker Fund, which designated him a \"senior analyst.\" As Rothbard continued his work, he enlarged the project. The result was Rothbard's book Man, Economy, and State, published in 1962. Upon its publication, Mises praised Rothbard's work effusively.\n"

"Worst heat wave ever? Washington, D.C. ties record for most straight 95+ days, more coming\n"
"\n"
"Asterisk indicates daily and monthly record high temperature. Gray text indicates predicted temperature.In terms of the duration of a punishing heat wave, the current spell has arrived at historic levels in Washington, D.C..\n"
"\n"
"For the 8th straight day (as of noon today, when it was 97), the temperature has reached at least 95 degrees - tying 2002, 1993, and 1987 for the most such days on record.\n"
"\n"
"Related link: 90 degree days in Washington, D.C.: Yearly, seasonal and monthly averages and extremes\n"
"\n"
"It’s very likely we will add three more days to this tally through Sunday - making this heat wave in D.C. history unmatched with respect to the miserable combination of length and intensity.\n"
"\n"
"How hot might it get?\n"
"\n"
"Triple-digit heat is possible daily through Sunday. The hottest day is likely to be Saturday, when highs may reach 102-106.\n"
"\n"
"What are the records? Will they be broken?\n"
"\n"
"NAM model projects 5 p.m. temperatures at or above 105 degrees Saturday. (Storm VistaWxmodels.com) * Today’s record high is 102. With a 97-degree reading as of noon, a tie of this record is achievable.\n"
"\n"
"* Friday’s record high is 103. This one may be tough to get.\n"
"\n"
"* Saturday’s record high is 102. We have a decent chance at this one and there’s a very outside chance we could flirt with our all-time high temperature (any date) of 106 set in 1930 and 1918.\n"

"NOAA’s Hydrometeorological Prediction Center predicts heat indices of near 110 Saturday near Washington, D.C. (NOAA) Humidity levels are going to remain moderate to high, adding 3-8 degrees to what the air temperature actually feels like - the heat index. Maxium heat indices through Sunday will be in the range of 100-107, except possibly near 107-112 on Saturday.\n"
"\n"
"The cause of the heat wave is a HUGE area of upper level high pressure - i.e. a heat dome - that has set all sorts of monthly and all-time records from the Rockies to the Southeast U.S. in the last one to two weeks. Wunderground’s Jeff Masters called the heat wave “one of the greatest in recorded history.”\n"

"By. Ruth Styles. PUBLISHED:. 04:08 EST, 12 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:28 EST, 12 November 2013. Meeting someone new isn't always the easiest of tasks, so spare a thought for China's young women who face intense parental pressure to find the right man. As a result, women terrified of returning home without a handsome other half resort to hiring 'boyfriends' for the duration of their visit. Now a shopping website, Taobao, has launched a new rent-a-boyfriend service which allows would-be fake other halves to advertise their services - complete with price lists. False romance: Women under pressure are resorting to fake boyfriends in a bid to impress their families. According to Chinese newspaper, the People's Daily, rent-a-boyfriends must be hired for a minimum of three days and offer a range of services including dinner (50 yuan, approximately £5) and shopping trips (30 yuan, approximately £3), on top of their 30 yuan hourly fee. Other services include seeing a film, although you will have to pay double if the movie is a thriller, and a 50 yuan peck on the lips, although hand-holding and a goodbye kiss on the cheek or forehead are free. 'I wanted to earn some pocket money when I had just graduated from university and started to work,' explains one advertiser, 27-year-old Matthew Fang from Chongqing. 'This rental business isn’t bad, especially during the Chinese Lunar New Year when there are family reunions.' End game: The women are searching for someone to marry but make do with a stand in while the hunt goes on. And business is booming for a reason. Chinese women in particular still face enormous parental pressure to meet a suitable man and rather than face a barrage of questions from nosy relatives, hire their men instead. According to Fang, the recruitment process begins with a preliminary meeting to discuss the client's requirements and to get their back story straight. Typically, the pair will exchange photos and will have a rehearsal before going ahead with the rental. Despite the detailed list of services and attempts - on both sides - to keep relations professional, some of the rent-a-boyfriends admit that it can, at times, be difficult. 'It all depends on how you look at it,' says another fake boyfriend, 26-year-old Xu Li from Yancheng City. 'If you look at it as a business, then it’s much easier.' The New York Observer has pinpointed a new phenomenon which sees wealthy Americans reject real friends in favour of a paid entourage. A fashion designer, who was anonymously quoted in The Observer’s piece much like rest of the article’s sources, told the paper: ‘There is a market, a currency for paid friends in New York. Some people need the money, and some people need the friends.’ But while being a paid friend might sound like an easy way to make a living, it's not always champagne bars and lavish dinners. ‘You’re always on someone else’s schedule — sort of like being a pet monkey,’ said one paid friend who lives between New York and LA. 'Being a paid friend is complicated,' he continued. 'When you’re in the presidential suite, it’s amazing, sometimes it can be emasculating, but I put my ego away a long time ago.’\n"

"Getting a dog to take his pills can be challenging, as many dogs are quite picky about what they eat and can even detect medication hidden in their food. However, there are various methods that you can use to help administer medication to your dog. Here are several techniques that you can try:\n"
"\n"
"1. Hide the pill in food or a treat:\n"
"One of the most common methods to give a pill to your dog is to hide it in something the dog readily enjoys eating. Some popular options include:\n"
"  a. Soft food: If your dog eats wet food, you can try hiding the pill inside a blob of wet food. Make sure the pill is completely concealed within the food.\n"
"  b. Peanut butter or cream cheese: These sticky foods can mask the pill entirely and make it difficult for the dog to separate the pill from the food.\n"
"  c. Treats: You can purchase pill pockets, soft treats specifically designed to hide pills inside. Alternatively, you can use other soft treats your dog likes, such as small pieces of cheese or hot dogs.\n"
"\n"
"2. Crush the pill and mix it with food:\n"
"If the pill can be crushed or opened (check with your veterinarian first), you can mix the contents with your dog's regular food or a small amount of a strong-smelling food, like canned fish or meat baby food. The aroma of the food can help mask the smell and taste of the medicine.\n"
"\n"
"3. Use a pill dispenser:\n"
"A pill dispenser is a small device that holds the pill while you position it in the dog's mouth. Gently insert the dispenser into your dog's mouth, aiming to place it towards the back of the throat, then release the pill. Close your dog's mouth and hold it shut while gently stroking its throat to encourage swallowing.\n"
"\n"
"4. Manually administer the pill:\n"
"This method may require some practice and patience, but it can be effective for dogs that cannot be tricked into taking pills otherwise.\n"
"  a. Place your dog on a higher surface like a table or counter, with a non-slip mat or towel, or have someone gently hold your dog still.\n"
"  b. Hold the pill between your index finger and thumb. With your other hand, gently hold your dog's muzzle from above and tilt the head back slightly.\n"
"  c. Use your free fingers to press on the gap between the upper and lower canine teeth, gently opening the mouth.\n"
"  d. Quickly and carefully place the pill as far back in the throat as possible, avoiding the sharp premolar teeth.\n"
"  e. Close your dog's mouth, hold it shut, and gently stroke the throat to encourage swallowing. You can also try blowing on the dog's nose, which may stimulate a swallowing reflex.\n"
"\n"
"5. Use a compounding pharmacy:\n"
"If your dog is extremely resistant to taking pills or if the medication causes a negative reaction, you can ask your veterinarian about using a compounding pharmacy. These pharmacies can transform the medication into a liquid, flavored chewable treat, or even a topical gel that may be more acceptable to your dog.\n"
"\n"
"Remember to always follow your veterinarian's instructions regarding medication administration, and provide positive reinforcement (praise, petting, or treats) after your dog has successfully taken its medication. It's essential to be patient and gentle during this process, as making it a positive experience will make it easier in the future."

"Provide the \"general orientation\" concerning both strategic and administrative priorities, as well as the \"specific orientation\" of the ministry in relation to key priorities.\n"
"\n"
"In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let's break down the above statement into its key components:\n"
"\n"
"1. General orientation: This refers to the overarching direction and guiding principles that define the general framework for decision-making, resource allocation, and activities to be carried out within a specific organization, in this case, the ministry. To provide this general orientation, it is important to have a clear understanding of the mission, vision, goals, and values of the ministry, as well as the broader context in which it operates, such as political, social, economic, or technological factors. This will help to identify priority areas and formulate long-term strategies to achieve the desired outcomes.\n"
"\n"
"2. Strategic priorities: These are the key objectives and goals that the ministry has identified as central to its mandate and that will drive its activities, policies, and programs. Strategic priorities should be aligned with the general orientation and informed by a thorough analysis of the and opportunities within the ministry's area of responsibility. Examples of strategic priorities could include improving access to public services, promoting innovation in a specific sector, or achieving measurable improvements in key performance indicators.\n"
"\n"
"3. Administrative priorities: In addition to strategic priorities, the ministry should also define its administrative priorities, which are the internal processes, structures, and systems that need to be in place to effectively deliver on its mandate and support the achievement of its strategic priorities. Administrative priorities might involve optimizing resource allocation, enhancing transparency and accountability, or modernizing management practices. Ensuring that these internal elements are aligned with the strategic priorities will contribute to the overall effectiveness and performance of the ministry.\n"
"\n"
"4. Specific orientation: While the general orientation provides a broad direction for the ministry, the specific orientation focuses on the key priorities that have been identified as particularly important, or that are expected to have a significant impact on the ministry's overall success. This may involve a more in-depth examination of one or more strategic priorities, or the identification of important initiatives, projects, or collaborations that will contribute to the achievement of the strategic priorities. Providing specific orientation involves clearly defining the desired outcomes, specifying the necessary actions and resources, and establishing mechanisms for monitoring progress and evaluating results.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, providing a general and specific orientation for the ministry is crucial for guiding its strategic direction, aligning priorities, and ensuring effective governance and management. By establishing a clear framework and setting out key priorities, the ministry will be better positioned to deliver on its mandate, address challenges, and seize opportunities, ultimately contributing to its overall success."

"The soldiers were proper and kept the vests but not the boots because of multiple factors that contributed to the decision-making process during their meticulous planning and execution. The reasons for choosing the vests over the boots can be classified under two primary headings:\n"
"\n"
"1. Functional Utility:\n"
"The soldiers, who were clad in their battle-hardened gear, found the vests to be more advantageous when it came to fulfilling their tactical objectives. The vests provided them with ample protection, enhanced mobility, and the flexibility required to adapt to rapidly evolving scenarios on the battlefield. With the integration of advanced materials and designs, the vests effectively shielded the soldiers from enemy fire and minimized injuries. Additionally, these vests facilitated the ideal weight distribution for carrying an extensive range of equipment and ammunition, thereby enabling the soldiers to partake in intensive combat operations while reducing fatigue.\n"
"\n"
"On the other hand, the boots failed to cater to the specific requirements and expectations of the soldiers. With prolonged use and exposure to harsh environmental conditions, the boots demonstrated shortcomings in terms of durability and resilience. Moreover, the subpar quality construction and absence of a suitable support system rendered the boots uncomfortable and incompatible with the intense physical demands of combat. This resulted in the soldiers opting against using the boots, as they were unsuitable for facilitating optimal performance.\n"
"\n"
"2. Adaptation to Terrain:\n"
"Varying geographical terrains played a pivotal role in influencing the soldiers' decision to keep the vests and discard the boots. The vests, being fundamental to their standard operational gear, facilitated seamless maneuverability and adaptability for diverse terrains and topographies. The adjustable and modular design of these vests further enabled the soldiers to modify their gear as per the unpredictability of the battlefield.\n"
"\n"
"In contrast, the boots were unable to cater to the adaptive nature required for traversing through different terrains. The suboptimal design, coupled with the lack of waterproofing, breathability, and insulation features, rendered the boots inefficient for withstanding diverse and extreme climatic conditions. Additionally, the undersized and rigid structure of the boots hampered the soldiers' ability to negotiate challenging obstacles and negotiate difficult terrains, thereby significantly diminishing their capability to adopt tailored combat strategies effectively.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the soldiers made a calculated decision to retain the vests and abandon the boots based on the two essential factors mentioned above. The vests proved to be superior in terms of functional utility, securely protecting the soldiers while allowing them to carry vital equipment with ease. Moreover, the vests aided the soldiers in adapting effortlessly to the dynamic battle terrains, thus ensuring the flawless execution of their operations. Conversely, the boots were deemed ineffective both in design and utility, affecting the soldiers' comfort and adaptability in challenging combat conditions, which ultimately led to their unanimous rejection."

"James could not hear the sound of his television in his neighborhood because the overall noise levels and disturbances emanating from various sources combined to create a densely cacophonous environment that rendered his auditory senses incapable of discerning the audio output from his television. This situation may have arisen due to several contributing factors, each amplifying the auditory chaos that enveloped the vicinity of his residence.\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, the neighborhood itself might be closely packed with houses and apartments, fostering a condensed living arrangement where the walls and barriers provide minimal insulation against the sounds produced by the inhabitants. As a consequence, mundane domestic activities like conversing, playing music, or utilizing appliances would reverberate throughout the locale, generating an incessant background noise that could easily overwhelm James's television audio.\n"
"\n"
"Moreover, it is highly plausible that large numbers of pedestrians and street traffic contribute to the heightened noise levels in the area. The constant hustle and bustle of people going about their daily lives, running errands, or engaging in conversations could lead to a cacophony of voices and footsteps. Additionally, a busy street with a steady flow of cars, buses, motorcycles, and other vehicles adds another layer of disturbance to the audioscape. The emissions arising from engines, honks, brakes, and steady whooshes of passing automobiles exacerbate the noise pollution affecting James's ability to hear his television clearly.\n"
"\n"
"Beyond the immediate residential and street scenarios, James's neighborhood could also be exposed to intrusive noise influxes originating from commercial establishments and ongoing construction work. Restaurants and pubs, usually found in populated areas, might host patrons who partake in lively discussions or even boisterous revelry, generating substantial noise spillage. Similarly, live music venues, nightclubs, or other entertainment options contribute significantly to the din pervading the surroundings. Meanwhile, ongoing construction projects in the vicinity – be it new developments, renovations, or infrastructure improvements – generate hammering, drilling, and machinery noises that could further impede James's efforts to hear his television.\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, James's neighborhood might be located near prominent noise sources, such as railroads, airports, or busy highways. The relentless stream of noise generated by trains, planes, or incessant road traffic would ultimately deprive the area of any semblance of peace and quiet. Consequently, the compounded acoustic chaos radiating from these disparate sources would obliterate the possibility of making out the television's audio output amidst the prevailing noise pollution.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, James's struggle to hear his television in his neighborhood arises from a range of factors that culminate in an inescapable cacophony. To address this issue, he might consider investing in noise-canceling headphones, soundproofing his residence, or opting for alternate entertainment methods like streaming services with subtitles, which can potentially alleviate the frustration caused by his audibility predicament."

"Most people are trying to have fun when going on vacation. The primary purpose of a vacation for a majority of individuals is to take a break from the daily grind and indulge in activities that bring them joy, excitement, and relaxation. Let us further explore why \"having fun\" is the most appropriate answer to the question above, as well as why humans generally seek out this experience during their vacations.\n"
"\n"
"1. Stress relief: In today's fast-paced world, humans face a lot of stress in their daily lives, be it from work, relationships, or personal issues. A vacation offers a valuable opportunity to break away from these stressors, allowing the individual to escape to a different environment and recharge their mental and emotional batteries. Engaging in fun activities during this time can significantly reduce feelings of stress and anxiety, making the person feel lighter and rejuvenated.\n"
"\n"
"2. Quality time with loved ones: One of the primary reasons people go on vacations is to spend quality time with family and friends. Participating in entertaining and enjoyable activities together helps strengthen the bond between loved ones, creating cherished memories and fostering a sense of togetherness. Shared experiences of fun and adventure allow people to connect on a deeper level, thus improving their relationships and overall well-being.\n"
"\n"
"3. Exploration and adventure: Vacations present numerous opportunities to explore new places, cultures, and experiences - all in the name of fun. Whether it is trying out a new activity, visiting an exotic location, or tasting unfamiliar cuisine, people typically seek out these novel experiences to break away from routine and expand their horizons. Engaging in such activities can be incredibly fulfilling and rewarding, as it not only broadens one's mindset but also cultivates a sense of personal growth.\n"
"\n"
"4. Opportunities for personal growth: Many people appreciate the chance to step out of their comfort zones during their vacations, as it enables them to learn new skills, face challenges, and grow as individuals. Activities such as trekking, scuba diving, learning a new language, or even volunteering can offer personal enrichment and development, all while ensuring that the individual partakes in amusement and enjoyment.\n"
"\n"
"5. Improved mental health and well-being: Engaging in fun activities on vacation, such as physical exercise, laughter, and exploration, can contribute to one's mental and emotional well-being. Not only do these experiences release endorphins - the body's natural mood elevators - but they also help increase self-esteem and foster a sense of achievement. Consequently, vacations can be seen as a catalyst for mental health improvement, encouraging relaxation, positivity, and overall happiness.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, when going on vacation, most people are primarily focused on having fun and creating memorable experiences. \"Having fun\" encompasses various aspects, such as stress relief, quality time with loved ones, exploration, personal growth, and improved mental well-being. These experiences allow individuals to enjoy a much-needed break from the monotony of daily life, ultimately contributing to a more balanced and fulfilled existence."
